ur3728510/		\tt0000439		10		for contemporary viewers , a dismissive mindset is often maintained when considering the earliest cinematic works , assuming that despite their undeniable influence on later pieces of cinema , the films themselves hold no real merit apart from examples of melodramatic acting and early , unskilled technical work . <sssss> such a mindset becomes effectively challenged when examining 1903 's the great train robbery , which , despite its simplistic plot , proves a fascinating historical and cultural artifact , and a tremendously effective example of early film-making and ensuing impact on the medium . <sssss> almost unanimously considered the first narrative film , the great train robbery can essentially function as a checklist of cinematic innovations , from its length -lrb- 12 minutes would have proved quite the epic in its day -rrb- to narrative techniques -lrb- cross cutting between the fleeing robbers and townspeople , a technique used almost constantly to build suspense to this day -rrb- to its daring use of partial colour creating a memorable aesthetic , the colour produced by animators hand colouring each frame of film it appears in . <sssss> at the same time , to reduce the film to its countless cinematic innovations would be to ignore just how impressively tense and thrilling a watch it proves in a contemporary context , even over a century after its initial release . <sssss> despite the film 's laudable contemporary impact , it still remains exceedingly difficult to envision just how brutal and harrowing a watch the film would have been when first screened in 1903 . <sssss> most noteworthy is the film 's surprising amount of violence -lrb- apart from the audacious , tense tense opening robbery and thrilling climactic gunfight , a helpless passenger is shot at point blank range and a guard is repeatedly bludgeoned into submission then casually tossed off the top of a moving train -rrb- , particularly for a viewing audience barely accustomed to motion pictures , yet alone ones with such intense content . <sssss> however , similarly intriguing is the film 's of the antagonists as central characters , also serving to pioneer the later prevailing thematic trend of lurid fascination with the criminal ` other ' and the deadly thrill of watching a criminal act be committed , which would later be further explored in genres such as the gangster film and film noir , or by directors such as alfred hitchcock . <sssss> the film also proves a masterful exercise in streamlined , concise film-making , wasting no time from start to finish in making full use of its 12 minutes , delineating the entire plot while still working in a quantity of action setpieces most contemporaries would struggle to keep up with , from the effectively jarring beginning , jumping immediately into the titular robbery to the triumphant final shootout . <sssss> if some points appear to drag , such as seemingly lengthy sequences of people walking and little other activity , they only serve to enunciate just how fast paced and eventful the rest of the film is that brief segments seem to slow down the breakneck , white - knuckle pace . <sssss> reflecting upon the film as a whole , it becomes apparent how emblematic the film itself can be regarding nearly everything ensuing motion pictures strove to achieve . <sssss> arguably pioneering the western , crime thriller and action film genres , the film in itself is in essence a later hollywood action sequence stripped of unnecessary exposition and filler , ably inventing attributes which would come to define the industry as a whole - thrill , spectacle and engaging emotional storytelling . <sssss> but the filmmakers show unprecedented cunning when pacing the film as well , punctuating slower sequences with punchy action setpieces to provide alternating thrills and respite from them , and even working in moments of throwaway humour -lrb- a bandit stumbles comically when carrying his stolen goods across a river -rrb- to lighten the mood . <sssss> most crucially , despite being only an early example of cinema , it is impossible to deny the chilling power of the unforgettable final image , the first close up in cinema history showing a bandit framed by a black background and gun smoke , firing his pistol straight at the viewer -lrb- a shot made timeless through its referencing in martin scorsese 's mob classic goodfellas -rrb- . <sssss> this singular image firmly solidified the authenticity and audience engagement the medium would later learn to explore and exploit , as horrified 1903 audience members , having never been exposed to anything of the kind , screamed and ducked under their seats or drew firearms and shot back , ultimately being convinced the image was reality . <sssss> the closing shot of the film effectively summed up the power , poignancy and vivacity the industry would later learn to capture routinely - in this respect , contemporary cinema as we know it was born through these sombre gunshots . <sssss> and , in an age where audiences more accustomed to the medium still proverbially ` duck ' from the cinematic gunshots ` fired ' at them -lrb- albeit less frantically -rrb- , the undeniable influence and inescapable power of the great train robbery will never truly be forgotten . <sssss> -10 / 10 
ur1019294/		\tt0000439		10		i just saw `` the great train robbery '' in its entirety for the first time and i was truly amazed . <sssss> its hard to believe that the film is over 100 years old . <sssss> it was shot from a stationary camera but it employs many of the cinematic techniques that have since become commonplace such as cross-cutting , the chase , the shootout etc. . <sssss> vci entertainment has released a marvelous 100 year anniversary edition of the film in two versions ... a completely silent version from the print owned by the u.s. library of congress and a second version with added music , color tints and sound effects . <sssss> briefly , the story -lrb- filmed in the `` wilds '' of new jersey -rrb- , centers on four bandits who subdue a station agent -lrb- to keep him from sending out an alarm -rrb- and then climb aboard a train when it stops to take on water . <sssss> two of the bandits proceed to the mail car , kill the agent and make off with the loot . <sssss> the others take care of the engineer and his fireman . <sssss> one can imagine what the early audiences must have thought when one of the bandits suddenly throws the fireman off of the train . <sssss> the cutting from the live action with the bandit and the fireman to the obvious dummy was quite innovative for the time . <sssss> the bandits then line up the passengers and rob them killing one of them as he tries to escape . <sssss> they then ride the engine down the tracks to their waiting horses . <sssss> meanwhile the town folk are alerted at a local hoedown and form a posse to go after the robbers . <sssss> what follows is a great little chase scene and the final showdown between the good guys and the bad guys , where you know who get what 's coming to them . <sssss> the closing shot of actor george barnes emptying his six shooter at the audience is perhaps one of the most famous shots in cinematic history . <sssss> one can only imagine the effect that it must have had on the early audiences . <sssss> i had always thought that this shot was at the beginning of the film . <sssss> early western pioneer `` broncho '' billy anderson plays four roles in the film including one of the bandits . <sssss> most of the scenes are filmed in medium to long shots . <sssss> you do n't really see the actors faces -lrb- except for barnes as noted -rrb- . <sssss> but it is still a very good film for this or any time . <sssss> it tells a complete and believable story in about 12 minutes and sets the stage for the many classic silent films that were to follow . <sssss> a truly historic cinematic experience .

ur10334028/		\tt0001013		7		following the release of ` the birth of the nation -lrb- 1915 -rrb- , ' director d.w. griffith has often been branded with the unfortunate attribute of being a racist . <sssss> while it 's difficult to argue with that film 's unabashed advocacy of the kkk , it 's also interesting to observe a few of griffith 's other films , in which he displays an undeniable sensitivity towards other cultures . <sssss> take , for example , ` broken blossoms -lrb- 1919 -rrb- , ' where a chinese immigrant -lrb- portrayed , admittedly , by american richard barthelmess -rrb- is shown to be , by far , the film 's most compassionate and respectable male character . <sssss> ` the red man 's view -lrb- 1909 -rrb- ' was one of hundreds of short films that griffith produced for the biograph company from , and it represents a pivotal step in the development of the western genre . <sssss> one of the earliest to explore the conflicts between native americans and european settlers , the film treats the plight of the indians with respect and empathy , quietly condemning the actions of the `` conquerers , '' who invaded the land and left countless tribes homeless . <sssss> living a comfortable and happy existence in the remote wilderness , a native american tribe goes about its daily business . <sssss> a young man , silver eagle -lrb- owen moore -rrb- , has fallen in love with a beautiful maiden , and it seems that nothing can come between the adoring couple . <sssss> however , as one might expect , a conflict of cultures is on the horizon . <sssss> a ragged pack of unkempt settlers emerges over the hill , pistols at their sides , and they arrogantly demand that the native americans move from the area . <sssss> after a brief but fruitless protest , the tribe chooses to avoid a violent confrontation and regretfully departs , but not before the nefarious settlers claim silver eagle 's young maiden as their own . <sssss> torn between the love for his sweetheart , and loyalty towards his dying father , the young man mournfully follows suit . <sssss> the tribe walks for miles , it seems , but they are unable to find a suitable place to live . <sssss> having been permanently uprooted from their home , they must accept the sad truth that their lives will never be the same again . <sssss> working with a running time of just eleven minutes , griffith has very little time to recruit our sympathies for the primary characters , but he does quite an good job . <sssss> there 's something inherently devastating in watching the tribe marching solemnly away from their spiritual home , a slow , sorrowful procession of broken souls . <sssss> for some reason , john ford 's ` the grapes of wrath -lrb- 1940 -rrb- ' -- another film about a displaced family -- came immediately to mind during these sequences ; it 's an uneven comparison , of course , but that 's just the association that my brain made . <sssss> griffith almost fools us into accepting a makeshift happy ending , as one settler suddenly attains a conscience and apologetically returns silver eagle 's maiden to him , but the conclusion is more tragic than anything else . <sssss> silver eagle mourns at the side of his deceased father , knowing that , even with his sweetheart by his side , his tribe has no home to which they can return . <sssss> if only for its unique storytelling perspective , ` the red man 's view ' is essential viewing for anybody wishing to experience yet another aspect of america 's first great director . 
ur2573293/		\tt0001913		9		how did griffiths pack so much into such a short wee film ? <sssss> this is a tale of a beautiful poor white girl , a confederate officer , an opportunistic upper class woman , and of the perspicacious and cunning loyal black retainer -lrb- sadly played in black-face -rrb- who is the real hero of the piece . <sssss> in a mere quarter of an hour the story of class consciousness and its stupidities , of reversal of fortunes , or true love and of the destruction of the old south is told with skill and artistry . <sssss> topped by the wonderful acting of dorothy west and even more so by the writing of emmett c. hall , this is a wonderful , action packed love and war story . <sssss> filmed only 47 years after the end of the war between the states , it is filled with exquisite touches : the utterly `` un-hollywood '' homely slouch hat ; the chickens running to escape ; the corn cob pipe ; the use of black powder with all its attendant smoke in the firearms . <sssss> there is a genuine attempt at some historical accuracy in this piece . <sssss> the looting of the mansion by the `` poor white trash '' foreshadows the russian revolution which followed close upon the release of `` swords and hearts '' . <sssss> at heart a sentimental romance but one with a courageous and determined woman at its centre .

ur0562732/		\tt0002208		10		the girl and her trust , like all films made in the early 1900s , is very simple and very short , but griffith introduces a number of filmmaking techniques that remain widely in use to this day . <sssss> earlier films generally played like a stage play , with minimal cutting or editing , and each scene taking place in the same location and generally in the same shot . <sssss> the girl and her trust was one of the first films to suggest that editing could create artificial environments by linking sets together , and it also gave a better idea of what exactly was going on -lrb- the close-up of the girl as she places the bullet in the keyhole is a great example -rrb- . <sssss> besides that , this film also had a very well-made chase at the end , in which the good guys are in a locomotive chasing the bad guys -lrb- the guys who stole the $ 2000 from the girl - her ` trust ' -rrb- who are pumping furiously on a railroad handcart . <sssss> although technically crude by today 's standards , this scene had every necessary element of a good chase sequence , and it works very well . <sssss> the film also introduced the idea of cross-cutting in filmmaking , as well as the idea of filming outdoors -lrb- a technique barely and clumsily employed by edwin porter in the great train robbery -rrb- . <sssss> the girl and her trust is a historic film , but as with all films that were made in the early 1900s , you need to keep its age in mind . <sssss> it 's not going to blow you away with visuals or sound , but if you keep in mind the time period in which it was made , you can begin to really appreciate its innovation . 
ur3063013/		\tt0002208		9		a lot of griffith 's shorts around this period were remakes of earlier biograph films , which just shows how he was constantly trying to refine and rework ideas . <sssss> this , a retelling of the acclaimed operator , is among the very best . <sssss> the gradual development of the acting in griffith 's films was now really beginning to bear fruit . <sssss> much has been made of use of props in this film . <sssss> the props not only help to define character by the way the performers handle them , but they actually set up elements of the story -- drawing our attention for example to the box of bullets . <sssss> this is a rare romantic lead role for wilfred lucas , seen a year or so earlier blacked up as the slave in his trust , but he is very good . <sssss> there 's also a bit of comic relief from walter long as the snubbed suitor at the very beginning . <sssss> there is more speed and complexity to the cutting in the girl and her trust than previous biograph pictures . <sssss> griffith was now experienced enough at setting up spaces and sequencing shots that he could get away with this many angles and set-ups without it looking like a jumbled mess . <sssss> the result is often exhilarating , and the really seems to have come of age . <sssss> the girl and her trust also features a rare tracking shot . <sssss> many have cited the lack of camera movement in griffith 's work as a weakness . <sssss> after all , they say , cameras had been moving since the early 1900s . <sssss> but i think griffith 's approach was intentional and informed , and could even be considered a forerunner of the `` invisible camera '' technique of directors such as john ford and joseph mankiewicz decades later -lrb- e.g. no camera movement unless following an actor or key object , so as to focus audience attention on the action , not the technical aspect -rrb- . <sssss> whatever the case , these tracking shots certainly do the trick . <sssss> it is particularly effective to show the train passing behind trees , posts and buildings , which help give the chase sequence a kind of beat and make it more intense . <sssss> what is really special about the girl and her trust though is its tight , even structure . <sssss> the tranquil beginning establishes the characters , the romantic angle and the possibility that danger may be near . <sssss> the action then begins with a claustrophobic , `` trapped heroin '' scenario , which is followed up with the excitement of a chase . <sssss> in the final moments , both the danger and the romance are resolved and , in perhaps the best closing shot of griffith 's biograph career , the train backs away from us , the lovers embrace , there is a blast of steam ... and fade out . <sssss> perfect . 
ur3063013/		\tt0002985		9		at a time when griffith 's films were becoming increasingly gloomy and pessimistic -lrb- see the painted lady , death 's marathon etc -rrb- the house of darkness , in spite of the title and its theme of madness , is a little ray of hope . <sssss> griffith uses all his skill and technique to produce a work of humanity and poignancy . <sssss> the opening shot is one of the most beautiful and considered of griffith 's biograph career , using contrasts in depth that are reminiscent of his earliest shorts , albeit far more carefully composed . <sssss> although it is a crowd shot , he has clearly given thought to every individual in it , giving each personal direction and allowing them to stand out . <sssss> griffith also contrasts the natural beauty of the setting with the plight of the asylum inmates , establishing a bittersweet tone right from the start . <sssss> griffith repeats his famous `` approaching '' close-up from musketeers of pig alley , having charles hill mailes gradually creep up on the camera until his face is almost filling the screen . <sssss> it 's not as effective as it was with elmer booth in pig alley , although there is some early use of foreground framing with the dangling branch . <sssss> two other close-ups have even greater impact . <sssss> first , there is the use of the ticking clock as a tension building device . <sssss> then there is that amazing close-up of claire mcdowell 's hands striking the piano key , which has a really great impact , releasing the tension which has just been built up and grabbing the audience 's attention simultaneously . <sssss> as with many of griffith 's films of this era , it is the acting which holds things together even more than the technical direction . <sssss> griffith knew that the performances had to be convincing for a film like this to work . <sssss> charles hill mailes was not often a lead player at biograph -lrb- he can mostly be seen playing stern fathers -rrb- , but he is very good here in a role which could easily have been all mugging and arm-waving . <sssss> interestingly claire mcdowell whom he menaces here was in reality his wife . <sssss> they actually played side by side as an elderly couple in a number of pictures in the 30 's . <sssss> this is a strong film with few flaws , and is among the four or five best biograph shorts . <sssss> although griffith had been wanting to make feature films for some years now , at this point he really looks ready to . 
ur2467618/		\tt0002985		7		this is a silent film by director d. w. griffith and stars lionel barrymore and lillian gish . <sssss> it is a very sincere but silly movie about the effects of music on psychotic patients in a hospital . <sssss> the film begins at the friendly neighborhood insane asylum . <sssss> a savage patient in brought in who attacks several of the staff and escapes with a loaded gun ! <sssss> well , instead of quickly catching them , he wanders into the home of the hospital director . <sssss> but , instead of killing his wife , the patient sees reason -- thanks to the healing power of music ! <sssss> tha lady begins to play and the man becomes rational and gives himself up to the authorities . <sssss> the movie is actually an interesting time capsule into the history of the treatment of the mentally ill . <sssss> instead of the chambers of horror some early hospitals had been -lrb- especially before the civil war -rrb- , this one is very modern in its thinking and institutes a program of music therapy . <sssss> while such progressive ideas did start to catch on at this time , it 's really ashamed the movie is n't correct about the curative powers of music -- if only it worked that well . <sssss> an interesting if somewhat bizarre time capsule .

ur1298724/		\tt0003323		7		between 1908 and 1913 d.w. griffith directed almost five-hundred short films for the biograph company . <sssss> once he and his troupe hit their stride they created dozens of superb dramas that set the standard for american cinema , featuring the best acting , cinematography , and editing of the era . <sssss> this particular movie , which dramatizes the director 's with the damage inflicted by `` do-gooders , '' may well hold the distinction of being the strangest film griffith ever made . <sssss> it certainly ranks alongside man 's genesis and for his son with the most unusual products of the director 's surviving output . <sssss> viewers familiar with griffith 's monumental 1916 feature film intolerance will recall that the modern story scenario paints a scathing portrait of `` reformer ladies , '' those interfering whose seemingly well-intentioned efforts to improve society cause more harm than good . <sssss> in the reformers we watch appalled as an average town is turned upside down by a group of self-appointed moralists known as the league of civic purity , a roving gang of puritans who disapprove of beer , smoking , dancing , vaudeville , movies , and just about everything but . <sssss> this is griffith 's version of `` it ca n't happen here , '' a dystopian fantasy of what the world would be like if the puritans took over and established a state where innocent pleasures -- along with some that are n't so innocent -- are strictly forbidden . <sssss> at the center of the story is a family consisting of father , mother , son and daughter . <sssss> father is a stern man who appears to be a minister . <sssss> when he is approached by members of the league to run for mayor he accepts the offer and tours the town , along with his wife and the ever-present league , and campaigns on street corners delivering impromptu speeches . <sssss> we notice a couple of things immediately : first , that the league is dominated by harsh , women in masculine attire , suggesting the suffragette caricature that prevailed at the time in newspaper cartoons , assisted by sissified men with pursed lips , all waving their wrists about in a very campy fashion . <sssss> second , we notice that once father becomes the league 's candidate for mayor he neglects his teenage children . <sssss> the children -lrb- played by biograph regulars bobby harron and mae marsh -rrb- reveal a rebellious streak in the opening sequence , when they put aside their homework to look at a pulpy magazine instead . <sssss> as soon as their parents depart , however , the kids lose all sense of discipline . <sssss> they quickly fall under the sway of a decadent friend of the boy 's , an older fellow who plies bobby with booze until he 's reeling , and who then attempts to seduce mae . <sssss> -lrb- a title card helpfully identifies this guy as `` a dangerous influence . '' <sssss> -rrb- griffith 's point is n't exactly subtle : while the reform candidate is out crusading against vice , members of his own household are falling victim to the very vices he denounces . <sssss> physician , reform thyself ! <sssss> the most interesting scenes involve the candidate 's efforts to `` right the world , '' in the words of another title card . <sssss> on the street father and the league members watch in righteous disapproval as a hooker approaches a potential customer . <sssss> father steps in , lectures them both sternly , and sends the woman on her way . <sssss> but when a smiling , pipe-smoking onlooker steps forward to congratulate the candidate , he is told to stop smoking -- and the man 's smile vanishes . <sssss> the reformers proceed to a saloon where father orders the denizens to cease drinking and dancing , although frankly the beer drinkers appear to be quite harmless , while the dancers in a genteel fashion . <sssss> by this point we are disturbed to notice that the league and their chosen leader travel with an entourage of uniformed police officers , cops who enforce these new codes of civic purity with . <sssss> this is the strangest and darkest element of the film . <sssss> this man is merely a candidate for office , not an elected official , yet he is abruptly presented as a feared authority figure with his own police force , and the league members are his cabinet . <sssss> i was especially fascinated by the sequence set in a vaudeville theater , where a raucous crowd is enjoying a pair of black-face comics . <sssss> -lrb- here we seemingly encounter what might be called the d.w. griffith problem , but it 's a false alarm ; the comedians are plainly presented as white performers practicing the minstrel tradition of the era , and are not meant to be taken for actual african americans . <sssss> -rrb- this scene plays almost like a keystone comedy , a resemblance boosted by the presence of keystone regular charles murray as a boisterous spectator . <sssss> when the reformers and their cops march into the theater the atmosphere chills noticeably , although murray tries to applaud the comedians when the cops are n't looking . <sssss> even when the minstrels finish , and are followed by a scene from shakespeare 's `` othello , '' the league members disapprove . <sssss> they take over the theater and lead the crowd in a hymn , and when spectators attempt to sneak out the cops force them to remain . <sssss> in this film 's brief running time the director managed to depict a nightmare world that 's just as chilling today as it must have looked in 1913 : a world ruled by humorless , narrow-minded prudes . <sssss> while no one would argue that prostitution or smoking are healthy pursuits , the authoritarian nature of this league of civic purity is a frightening thing to behold , and reminds us of the totalitarian scourges that blighted so many societies during the 20th century , in the years after this film was made . <sssss> -lrb- besides , what 's so bad about the ? <sssss> or shakespeare ? <sssss> -rrb- but griffith saved his thesis statement for the final scene , when the league 's leader , the father , returns home to find that his children have quickly gone to hell in his absence . <sssss> this man who believes he can `` right the world '' ca n't even maintain the stability of his own household . <sssss> and if that reminds you of any real-life public figures from the past century or two , well , i think that was no accident .

'' <sssss> it is probable that this entire movie is based on a vaudeville routine . <sssss> both sennett and sterling had vaudeville backgrounds . <sssss> and probably saw routines very much like this . <sssss> in a recent article called `` the cheese that stands alone , '' ben schwartz in `` 's quarterly '' notes the many films based on the bad smell of cheese : `` the movie , oh ! <sssss> that limburger : the story of a piece of cheese -lrb- 1906 -rrb- , in which two boys slip limburger into their father 's pockets , after which he is chased out of his office by his co-workers . <sssss> still , it 's doubtful andrea foresaw how the new media of silent films aimed at younger , modern audiences would offer up limburger as a comedy star . <sssss> they include limburger and love -lrb- 1910 -rrb- and , conversely , love and limburger -lrb- 1913 -rrb- , a strong revenge -lrb- 1913 -rrb- , adventures of limburger and schweitzer -lrb- 1914 -rrb- , limburger 's victory -lrb- 1915 -rrb- , a case of limburger -lrb- 1915 -rrb- , a limburger cyclone , -lrb- 1917 -rrb- , and the katzenjammer kids cartoon , down where the limburger blows -lrb- 1917 -rrb- . <sssss> in chaplin 's shoulder arms -lrb- 1918 -rrb- , the comedian plays a gi at the front who receives limburger in a care package . <sssss> he needs a gas mask to get near it , and then throws the cheese into an enemy trench forcing thirteen german soldiers to surrender . <sssss> as a war hero , limburger found one of its few positive images . '' <sssss> what is amazing about this movie , which is really one long and one short practical joke , is the ability of the actors to make you see how bad the cheese smells . <sssss> the facial expression by normand and the rest of the cast are so good , that you feel how bad the cheese smells . <sssss> this movie was made about six months after keystone started . <sssss> it is interesting to note that the movie ends with the limburger cheese being thrown in an actor 's face . <sssss> this was before keystone starting using the thrown pie in the face gag . <sssss> this film can be seen as an important precursor and father of that gag .

ur4465624/		\tt0004189		10		keystone and max sennett liked to improvise stories as they went along . <sssss> he was the first guerrilla filmmaker -lrb- to use a phrase that was popular in the 1960 's -rrb- . <sssss> henry pathe lehrman was assigned to direct chaplin after sennett hired him . <sssss> as we know they did not get along . <sssss> lehrman was perhaps understandably jealous . <sssss> chaplin had been hired to replace ford sterling as keystone 's lead comic . <sssss> lehrman probably thought that he should get a shot as he had been working with sennett for some four years , with over 50 films to his acting credits and some 35 to his director credits , and chaplin was a vaudevillian who had not made a film before . <sssss> one can see this film as a kind of test for chaplin . <sssss> given just an event for the background , could chaplin come up with a film story on the spur of the moment . <sssss> it was almost an intelligence test , like putting a new rat in a maze to see if it can find the cheese . <sssss> only in this case , the rat breaks all the records for finding the cheese . <sssss> chaplin passes the test with flying colors . <sssss> chaplin holds to a single idea or theme and just repeats and elaborates on it , like a baroque musical work by bach . <sssss> chaplin is just a at the event who becomes fascinated by the documentary camera filming the event . <sssss> he wants to be in the movies and so he stands in front of the camera and preens himself like a peacock . <sssss> the bystander imagines that he can become a movie star simply by stepping in front of the camera . <sssss> one can almost hear director lehrman telling chaplin , `` you think it is so easy to become a movie star ? <sssss> you think you can just step in front of a camera and become a star ? <sssss> do it . <sssss> i dare you . '' <sssss> chaplin takes the dare and is absolutely hilarious as he drives the story director played by the real director lehrman crazy . <sssss> there is no story here . <sssss> this is minimalist guerrilla cinema . <sssss> chaplin stands in front of the camera , chaplin walks in front of the camera , chaplin runs in front of the camera and chaplin tosses his hat in front of the camera and retrieves it . <sssss> this is not a plotted story , it is just the camera finding , discovering and falling in love with chaplin . <sssss> lehrman should get a great deal of credit for this movie as well as chaplin . <sssss> he allows his real anger at chaplin to be displayed for all the world to see . <sssss> the greatest joke is that we , the audience , do n't understand that the anger is real , barely disguised in the spontaneous plot . <sssss> watching the behavior of the crowds , the kiddie race cars and the cameraman cranking the camera are bonus treat here . <sssss> it just adds to fun of chaplin boldly announcing his presence in the world of cinema . <sssss> the last shot is a close-up of chaplin making a funny face at the camera . <sssss> it is a shocking close-up that rivals the last shot of `` the great train robbery . '' <sssss> instead of a gun going off , we have chaplin making a funny face a few inches from the camera lens and having his nose squeezed . <sssss> it is a great shot that only lasts a moment , but leaves us wanting more . <sssss> this is not so much a film as a record of the descent of the great god pan to earth . <sssss> no funnier or happier footage has been shot in the 100 years since . 
ur2567338/		\tt0004189		3		as many reviewers noted , chaplin 's second film is historically important in so far as it is the first screen appearance of him dressed as the tramp . <sssss> however , the film remains just that , a historical landmark . <sssss> as a comedy , it is experimental in that it has a factual setting rather than a fictional one in a studio . <sssss> the film has something to do with the tramp trying to get a picture of himself to send to his girlfriend , as the bookends of the film make clear . <sssss> however , the film consists of nothing more than the tramp deliberately blocking the camera crew trying to film the kids ' auto races at venice . <sssss> the director of the crew -lrb- and of the film -rrb- shoves the tramp back several times , so he can continue filming . <sssss> the most amusing thing is that the tramp has his back to the autos turning the corner where filming occurs , so one wonders whether chaplin received direction to get out of the way ahead of time or whether it was all ad-libbed like much of the other films of the period . <sssss> as a keystone comedy , it lacks panache . <sssss> * of 4 stars . 
ur2467618/		\tt0004189		1		in 1914 , charlie chaplin began making pictures . <sssss> these were made for mack sennett -lrb- also known as `` keystone studios '' -rrb- and were literally churned out in very rapid succession . <sssss> the short comedies had very little structure and were completely ad libbed . <sssss> as a result , the films , though popular in their day , were just awful by today 's standards . <sssss> many of them bear a strong similarity to home movies featuring obnoxious relatives mugging for the camera . <sssss> many others show the characters wander in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing . <sssss> and , regardless of the outcome , keystone sent them straight to theaters . <sssss> my assumption is that all movies at this time must have been pretty bad , as the keystone films with chaplin were very successful . <sssss> the charlie chaplin we know and love today only began to evolve later in chaplin 's career with keystone . <sssss> by 1915 , he signed a new lucrative contract with studios and the films improved dramatically with chaplin as director . <sssss> however , at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable . <sssss> no , chaplin as the cute little tramp was still evolving . <sssss> in 1916 , when he switched to mutual studios , his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy -- in many of the previous films he was just a jerk -lrb- either getting drunk a lot , beating up women , provoking fights with innocent people , etc. -rrb- . <sssss> the final evolution of his little tramp to classic status occurred in the 1920s as a result of his full-length films . <sssss> once again , in this short , there is n't much plot . <sssss> no wait , ... there 's zero plot . <sssss> the keystone crew went on location -lrb- as they often did -rrb- to a kids racing event -lrb- kind of like a soapbox derby -rrb- and told chaplin to just wander on and off the track again and again for the entire film . <sssss> apart from that , he did nothing except getting punched a few times for getting in the way . <sssss> there is no coherence to this piece and it 's only important for historical reasons -- especially since this was the first time on film chaplin dressed as the little tramp . 
ur2467618/		\tt0004311		7		i 've seen quite a few chaplin shorts from early in his career and i 've noticed that his early stuff -lrb- done for keystone studios -rrb- is pretty dreadful stuff . <sssss> unlike his wonderful full-length films from the 20s and 30s , the films from 1914-1915 are incredibly poorly made -- having no script but only vague instructions from the director . <sssss> in most cases , the films had almost no plot and degenerated to people punching and kicking each other . <sssss> this movie has a very thin plot . <sssss> charlie is either working at a movie set or he sneaks in -- it 's not sure which . <sssss> and , he makes a mess of everything until he 's thrown out , ... only to return in drag ! <sssss> the director thinks charlie 's a hot tamale and begins making passes at him/her ! <sssss> actually , i was shocked just how good chaplin looked as a girl ! <sssss> he probably could have passed as a woman in public . <sssss> fyi -- this is the second film in which chaplin appeared in drag . <sssss> it also features fatty arbuckle in a cameo playing , i think , himself . 
ur19112908/		\tt0004457		7		having now seen all of baum 's oz films , i can say with certainty that this film is the best acted of any of them . <sssss> even the animal impersonators brought a spark of life and whimsy to their characters that few men in animal suits can approach ! <sssss> fred woodward 's woozy is funny , irritable , and ridiculous , just as he should be . <sssss> as always , it 's fascinating to see how baum imagined oz , but this is the best look we get at how he imagined the oz celebrities . <sssss> unfortunately , we do n't get to see dorothy in this film , but we do get to see ozma , briefly . <sssss> she is just as he described her - beautiful , ethereal , almost floating above the earth with grace , but she is still full of joy and humor . <sssss> you should go see this movie , definitely ! 
ur1298724/		\tt0004518		3		on the set of modern times in the mid-1930s charlie chaplin spoke wistfully to journalist gilbert seldes about how , in his early days making movies , he 'd simply go to the nearest park with a cop and a pretty girl and they 'd make up the story as they went along . <sssss> recreation looks very much like the kind of film he was waxing nostalgic about : it 's a brief , rudimentary sketch involving a rivalry between charlie and a sailor over the sailor 's girl . <sssss> the fighting begins almost immediately , many bricks are thrown , cops get involved , and eventually everybody winds up in the lake . <sssss> it certainly looks improvised , and i 'm sure the actors had fun , but the film amounts to little more than a few minutes of slapstick mayhem . <sssss> scripts as such were seldom used at keystone , but if there 'd been one for this movie it would have read : `` throw brick . <sssss> react . <sssss> hide behind tree . <sssss> grimace . <sssss> throw brick , '' etc. etc. . <sssss> spontaneity is the main thing recreation has going for it ; that , and brevity . <sssss> i can understand why the middle-aged chaplin felt sentimental about the simplicity of filmmaking in his early days , but the fact is , modern times is a great film while this one is n't . <sssss> to put it another way , nostalgia for youthful spontaneity is all well and good , but there 's a lot to be said for craftsmanship . <sssss> the chaplin who made modern times was an experienced craftsman , but the young fellow who cranked out recreation in a park one day was still an apprentice learning his trade , and the results are slight . <sssss> another drawback : none of the familiar keystone players appear in support , so there 's no mabel , no roscoe , no chester conklin or edgar kennedy for us to enjoy . <sssss> the other actors in this movie are n't very interesting , and the sailor in particular is a real ham . <sssss> there are a couple of nice little moments , however . <sssss> at the beginning charlie is on a bridge , apparently contemplating suicide . <sssss> he hoists one leg up on the railing and then the other , and swiftly falls on his butt . <sssss> it 's a dexterous maneuver we associate with buster keaton , who performed it all his life . <sssss> the second moment arrives later on , when charlie picks up a brick -lrb- yet again -rrb- to hurl at his rival the sailor . <sssss> he 's interrupted when a cop comes along , catching him in the act as he 's about to wind up and pitch . <sssss> smoothly , instead of throwing the brick , charlie acts as if he 's examining it , appraising its condition , and then he wipes it off carefully and returns it to its original spot . <sssss> in that brief bit , just for a few seconds , chaplin demonstrates his characteristic finesse and makes viewing this short worthwhile . 
ur2567338/		\tt0004518		4		chaplin tangles with a sailor for the affections of a girl , which is certainly not an original plot at this point for chaplin . <sssss> the actors are also of notably less quality than in other early chaplin films . <sssss> before it 's all said and done , there 's , the face-slapping and ducking routine , and keystone cops getting kicked into a lake . <sssss> i would be curious to find out how the fascination with initiated in silent films . <sssss> chaplin does have a few chaplin-like moments : at the beginning when he tries putting his legs up over the bridge , when the cop catches him about to throw a brick and he changes his demeanor instantaneously , and when using his cane to prod the behind of the girl he vied for next to the lake . <sssss> this is typically what would be referred to today as one of chaplin 's `` park comedies .

ur2483625/		\tt0004635		6		the squaw man is a film that was probably dated before it even hit the screen in 1914 . <sssss> young cecil b. demille , an average playwright and protégé of david belasco became interested in the new medium of motion pictures . <sssss> he saw film as the path to much quicker success than he would have on broadway . <sssss> buying this victorian era play the squaw man with his partners jesse l. lasky and sam goldfish -lrb- wyn -rrb- , demille got broadway star dustin farnum interested and wanted to cut him in on the profits as well . <sssss> farnum said no he would just take a straight salary . <sssss> what these three would have been giving him is a quarter interest in what eventually became paramount pictures . <sssss> the reason the company went west was to avoid the strong arm tactics of the edison corporation which was trying to stamp out independent film makers . <sssss> they did n't reach out as far as california . <sssss> the story is dated , old fashioned and quite frankly racist beyond belief . <sssss> farnum plays a cashiered british army officer who takes the blame for his older brother who was going to inherit an earldom . <sssss> but brother stole the regimental funds . <sssss> so farnum takes the fall in the best british stiff upper lip tradition . <sssss> he also leaves behind fiancé winifred kingston . <sssss> off to the american west goes farnum where he buys some land and sets up as a rancher . <sssss> he also marries an indian maid played by red wing , a real indian . <sssss> after some of the usual western situations involving some bad guys , farnum finds out the brother is dead and he can come home . <sssss> his son will be a future earl as well , but he ca n't bring red wing into polite society . <sssss> so he asks and she does give up him and her son , a rather mind boggling situation that today 's audiences just would n't buy . <sssss> they would condemn it and rightly so . <sssss> still those were the attitudes of the times . <sssss> in demille 's autobiography he relates that before he left for california he went over to new jersey where a lot of films were shot back then to get a primer on just how this unfamiliar new medium worked . <sssss> after about 20 minutes of watching some action sequences being filmed , he said that if this was all there was to it , he 'd make the greatest films ever made . <sssss> if he did n't do that , demille was a visionary and realized the possibilities of motion pictures . <sssss> it 's for that realization that he 's honored today . <sssss> and this first version of the squaw man is a piece of living history . 
ur45193665/		\tt0004681		10		although cruder and rather primitive when compared to the 1922 version , this tess from 1914 has it 's share of enchantments . <sssss> when watching this film , one should view it through the eyes and mind of a 1914 audience . <sssss> feature films were in their beginnings , and this was mary pickford 's fifth feature . <sssss> movies themselves were now accepted and very popular among every class . <sssss> there was something about watching mary pickford that moved silent-era movie goers , and `` tess of the storm country '' elevated her to a new , higher star status . <sssss> audiences went wild over tess , and it broke records on four continents , and mary was forever set apart from other actors , as the first modern celebrity created through moving pictures . <sssss> the star 's charisma starts right from the opening credits . <sssss> a very ethereal mary pickford , in delicate dress , steps from behind a curtain , with a of roses , she sets them into a nearby vase , and in the arranged bouquet , she buries her lovely face , framed by those famous curls , the epitome of feminine beauty . <sssss> then enters tess , a feisty and strong-willed girl , in tattered dress . <sssss> mary 's performance is brilliant , as it runs the gamut of her emotions , from a childish appeal and sprightly comedy to the finest of dramatic pathos . <sssss> the film itself has some stunning exterior scenes , that were shot in what would now be called `` deep focus '' . <sssss> the locations were filmed suitably in del mar and at the japanese fishing village in santa monica . <sssss> with all of this , one can understand and appreciate the audiences feelings at the time , the magnetic grip mary pickford held , and why this was mary 's favourite character , to re-create again in 1922 . <sssss> thankfully this film survives , and is still a fascinating silent movie to watch . 
ur1298724/		\tt0004693		5		during his first year in the movies charlie chaplin appeared in some thirty-five films at mack sennett 's keystone studio , usually in the leading role . <sssss> most of these were single reel comedies lasting about 10 minutes apiece , but there were a number of two-reel shorts along the way as well as one feature film under sennett 's direction , tillie 's punctured romance , in which chaplin played the villain . <sssss> chaplin 's apprenticeship for sennett taught him the fundamentals of film-making , but some of these comedies do n't hold up terribly well today . <sssss> of course if you 're a chaplin buff even his weakest films are of interest , but the casual viewer who stumbles across the keystones looking for old-time movie chuckles may be disappointed , especially if viewing them on a tv screen . <sssss> the films come to life with an audience , but chaplin seems to lose part of his essence when seen on video . <sssss> those love pangs , a one-reel short which co-stars charlie with chester conklin , is neither the best nor the worst of the keystone series . <sssss> like most of them it looks improvised from scene to scene , and the humor is pretty crude , but it also has a handful of moments in which we can see chaplin 's special talent emerging . <sssss> the story is based loosely on charlie 's rivalry with chester over various women , and begins with a low comedy routine involving the guys alternately sticking each other in the butt with a fork through a curtain . <sssss> even here charlie finds an unexpected gag : when chester confronts him , charlie assumes an innocent expression as he holds the fork to his teeth and tries to pass it off as a `` . '' <sssss> this is followed by more physical comedy between the guys , rather well choreographed , and not as frenzied as the grappling found in some of the other keystones . <sssss> once they leave their boarding house charlie & chester encounter two attractive young women in a nearby park , a brunette and a blonde . <sssss> in his book the chaplin encyclopedia author glenn mitchell wonders if it 's being suggested here that the ladies are prostitutes ; certainly there are clues pointing in that direction . <sssss> my interpretation is that charlie initially assumes the brunette is a prostitute -lrb- when she flirts with him , he checks his money supply -rrb- , but that he 's mistaken . <sssss> when her boyfriend arrives and finds them together , and asks who charlie is , the girl defends herself by indicating something like ' i do n't know this guy , and he 's annoying me . ' <sssss> the boyfriend is hostile towards charlie thereafter . <sssss> the blonde woman , however , does seem to be a hooker , and to be `` chester 's girl '' at that , as demonstrated by her slavish behavior towards him . <sssss> in their first scene together she excitedly greets him by name , lavishes him with affection , and even kneels before him . <sssss> and then -- ah-ha ! <sssss> -- she reaches into her shoe , takes out a fat wad of bills , and hands it over . <sssss> their relationship is clear . <sssss> charlie , meanwhile , has a mildly comic scene with a policeman and then engages in more knockabout with chester and the brunette 's boyfriend . <sssss> he winds up with both of the ladies in a nearby cinema . <sssss> there we 're treated to a nice shot of charlie sitting between the two woman , one under each arm , as he blissfully kicks his feet in the air . <sssss> but the bliss ca n't last forever , for soon his two rivals show up and actually hurl him through the movie screen ! <sssss> those love pangs is not one of chaplin 's finest achievements , just another one-reel comedy he cranked out while learning his craft , but there are a few funny bits . <sssss> for some viewers the most interesting element here may be the issue of how the two ladies earn a living . 
ur0562732/		\tt0004693		7		in the rival , chaplin is in full tramp form and with plenty of kicking and punching and yanking people around with his cane , although i have to say that there are at least a few things that make this film stand out among the huge number that he was churning out for keystone in 1914 . <sssss> first of all , it contains what has to be charlie 's most stylish cigarette lighting ever , it 's classic . <sssss> he oozes hilarious confidence , he 's almost like a mobster . <sssss> also , it is one of the few films where a woman passes by him and stops to check him out , rather than the other way around . <sssss> i also found it interesting that chester conklin seems to be trying to copy charlie 's outfit . <sssss> he appears in pants which are wildly too big for him and hang limply off his hips , an outrageously tiny shirt and tie and an ill-fitting jacket , a little too similar to chaplin 's classic outfit not to notice . <sssss> it should be noted , however , that conklin ultimately performed in nearly 300 films , almost four times as many as chaplin , but there is clearly no question about who was the more talented filmmaker and/or actor . <sssss> at any rate , the rival , also known as those love pangs -lrb- this was still back when all of chaplin 's films had a whole list of different names , mostly due to callous re-editing and re-releasing -rrb- , is one of his lesser comedies , as very little happens other than a few mildly amusing gags and a few appearances of what would become chaplin 's unmistakable style . <sssss> expectations were much lower back then for these films -lrb- as they should remain today when watching them -rrb- , but chaplin had done much better before . 
ur3063013/		\tt0004766		7		this was cecil b. demille 's first picture as sole credited director . <sssss> like the better known yet inferior squaw man , which he co-directed with oscar apfel , it is a western starring dustin farnum . <sssss> unlike its predecessor , the virginian bears the hallmarks of having been made by a classy albeit inexperienced director , and the definite demille style is beginning to emerge . <sssss> part of the virginian 's superiority over the squaw man is its tighter storyline . <sssss> this is probably helped by the fact that it unswervingly follows genre convention . <sssss> the western may have been in its infancy , but even in 1914 the iconic cowboy and his inevitable shootout with the villainous outlaw were already synonymous with it . <sssss> one factor which characterises this as an early western is the theme of an outsider coming to the west -- in this case the love interest molly . <sssss> at this time the west was not yet old , and it was an exotic place for easterners to discover . <sssss> there 's already something of a shift going on here though as the hero himself is an established westerner . <sssss> i have to say , dustin farnum looks a lot more comfortable here playing the genuine cowboy as oppose to the english gentlemen traveller of the squaw man . <sssss> right from the start , cecil demille differed somewhat in approach from dw griffith in that he was most concerned with what went on in individual shots rather than the relationship between them , favouring long takes and rich compositions . <sssss> he shows some promise here , making good aesthetic use of depth and balance , although he 's not quite there yet when it comes to clarifying action and character . <sssss> for example , he introduces the villain trampas with a title card , then confuses us by showing three men sitting round the table . <sssss> our eyes will probably be drawn to the man on the left with the large sombrero , but it 's only thirty seconds or so into the scene that we realise it 's the man on the right who is trampas . <sssss> some more typical -- and innovative -- demille touches emerge later . <sssss> demille was one of the first filmmakers to convey psychology through technique . <sssss> for example , when farnum and his pal steve are fondly remembering their adventures together , he literally shows their memories on screen in a superimposed image . <sssss> of course , this technology had been around since melies ' heyday fifteen years earlier , but demille is using it to photograph thought . <sssss> you do n't see anything like that in the work of melies , or griffith for that matter . <sssss> by and large however , de mille is still taking his lead from griffith , which is fair enough as griffith was the undisputed master at the time . <sssss> his staging and use of close-ups looks very much like that in the biograph shorts . <sssss> there 's also some parallel editing to contrast the diverging paths of steve and farnum , when the former falls in with the cattle rustlers and the latter falls in with the school ma'am . <sssss> the later demille tended to keep individual scenes intact . <sssss> however , it would not be long before fully-fledged classics such as the cheat would appear . 
ur2264263/		\tt0004766		6		so i watched this with a couple of friends and i do n't know if demille did it on purpose , but it has got a high value of comical performances . <sssss> actors are portraying this silent as if they were the main characters in a shakespeare play . <sssss> sometimes they overact so much it becomes silly and even stupid . <sssss> that 's why my friends and i enjoyed it so much . <sssss> they were telling each other what the persons in the movie must have been thinking . <sssss> things as ` get that gun out of my ass ' and ` do n't you touch my horse ' came spontaneously out of our minds , which made the old movie funnier to look at . <sssss> it was generally stupid . <sssss> i broke a finger while watching this movie and that did hurt a lot , more than i enjoyed the picture . 
ur4202340/		\tt0005077		7		being the second last of chaplin 's essanay films , carmen is a parody of cecil b. demille 's drama with the same title . <sssss> it stands as quite obvious that demille 's acknowledged film did n't impress the comedy king that much , which he later admitted in his autobiography . <sssss> parodies were not a new experiment for chaplin . <sssss> he had done several of them already , namely his prehistoric past and his new job , and would continue to do so until the very end of his career in films -lrb- for instance in a king in new york -rrb- . <sssss> chaplin does a very good portrayal of don josé , and edna purviance 's is very as good as carmen . <sssss> neither act as we are used to ; charlie is not the lovable tramp and edna is far from an innocent little woman , but that was not chaplin 's intentions , either . <sssss> a burlesque on carmen is a somewhat odd , very different , but includes good material nonetheless . <sssss> the main story is , although very differently structured , as in the original drama . <sssss> don josé is very much in love with carmen , but is not alone in that field ; `` carmen , carmen , -lrb- the -rrb- beautiful carmen , -lrb- is -rrb- loved by all men under 96 , '' but he has the big advantage that he is an officer , and there we are ; this is the famous story about rivalry , love , greed and honor , seen from a humorous perspective . <sssss> thanks to chaplin 's and purviance 's performances , and to the wonderful , wonderful music by george bizet which i highly admire , this could actually have been a masterpiece , it 's time taken into consideration . <sssss> it could have been . <sssss> but unfortunately , although it is a good pretty good comedy , i do n't feel it 's fair to blame people who claim that a burlesque of carmen is far from being a masterpiece . <sssss> but it 's important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with any lack of talent , but rather a result of conflicts concerning business . <sssss> when chaplin refused to essanay contract after completing his last film for the company , police , they took revenge by editing back all the scenes chaplin originally had edited out from carmen . <sssss> thanks to this , the film is somewhat confusing and has several pointless scenes which are more annoying than funny , and the film turned out to be rather a ben -- turpin played -- than a . <sssss> naturally , chaplin was in despair when he discovered what essanay had done , and had to stay in bed for several days . <sssss> despite its obvious flaws , a burlesque of carmen is highly recommended to and to admirers of beautiful music . 
ur17722856/		\tt0005078		7		a silent movie directed by cecil b. demille and starring sessue hayakawa , we get to see avarice , lust , and rampant racism at their glorious best . <sssss> worst . <sssss> whatever . <sssss> hayakawa is excellent in this movie . <sssss> demille lights him as if he were the female star , and he gives a great performance in mime . <sssss> the version i saw was the 1918 re-release , and the main character had been changed from japanese to burmese after a prolonged protest from the japanese-american community . <sssss> -lrb- this was very simple for a silent film - they just changed a few title cards and the character 's name . <sssss> -rrb- fanny ward plays edith , spendthrift wife of richard hardy , young stockbroker . <sssss> he 's got all his money invested in a company and is waiting for the payoff . <sssss> she insists on continuing to spend thousands of dollars on frocks and lingerie ; at one point another man convinces her that richard has made an error in judgment , so she gives the guy $ 10,000 from the red cross fund to double her money in the morning . <sssss> naturally , it 's all lost , and the red cross directors ask her to send the ten grand to the belgians that day . <sssss> edith has been seeing rather a lot of haka arakau -lrb- hishuru tori in the first release -rrb- , an ivory merchant who is quite wealthy . <sssss> although she is not at all in love with him , she is amused by him while her husband spends all his time on investments . <sssss> arakau , though , is smitten with edith . <sssss> he offers to lend her money , which she at first refuses ; she has no way out , though , when the fund she 's lost is requested . <sssss> she agrees to let arakau lend her the money , but he makes it clear that he requires sexual favors -lrb- without ever saying it , of course -rrb- in exchange . <sssss> she agrees rather than face social disgrace -lrb- worse in her status than the theft -rrb- . <sssss> richard is aware of arakau seeing his wife , he knows there is nothing going on really , but he 's disturbed by it . <sssss> hayakawa is very good at being very attentive without being over attentive , and arakau a very handsome , very wealthy man . <sssss> when arakau lends her the money , she 's saved from exposure ; his demands , though , are instant . <sssss> he demands her presence that night . <sssss> richard 's money comes in , and she asks for $ 10,000 , so of course he writes her a check -lrb- i ca n't imagine what $ 10,000 was worth in 1915 -rrb- . <sssss> she takes it with her to her rendezvous with arakau , but he insists on his interest in addition to the money . <sssss> she fights him , and he picks a hot seal -lrb- a chop , in japanese , i think -rrb- from his container of embers -lrb- do n't we all have a container of embers on our desk ? <sssss> -rrb- , rips her bodice from her back , and brands her on her left shoulder blade . <sssss> this is a remarkable scene for its violence and his avarice and lust . <sssss> their struggle is completely believable . <sssss> demille lights hayakawa 's face just as he might have lighted brooks or dietrich . <sssss> edith shoots hayakawa in the shoulder , wounding him . <sssss> richard , discovering edith has left home , follows his suspicions to arakau 's home , discovers that his wife has shot the man , and claims to have done the deed himself when the police arrive . <sssss> edith visits richard in jail , and again demille uses lighting dramatically to emphasize richard 's wrongful imprisonment and her wrongful freedom . <sssss> at the trial , arakau knows that imprisoning richard will hurt edith worse than telling the truth , so he lies and says richard shot him . <sssss> richard takes that stand and confesses . <sssss> i 'm sorry to say that these few minutes tried my credulity : why have a trial when richard confessed from the beginning ? <sssss> the jury goes out , considers , and returns , and edith is shown wringing her hands in tension over what in the world the verdict could be . <sssss> let me see , the victim says richard shot him , richard says he shot him - what could the jury fine ? <sssss> guilty ! <sssss> big surprise . <sssss> edith then goes into hysterics , bares her shoulder to the whole court and says she shot arakau because of what he did to her . <sssss> the courtroom erupts in lynching mode , but calms down . <sssss> the judge sets aside the verdict and the prosecutor sets aside the indictment , and richard and edith walk out of the room surrounded by spectators as if at their wedding . <sssss> this is a good movie notwithstanding it is silent . <sssss> hayakawa shows his talent even this early , but he had to wait for his role in `` bridge on the river kwai '' in 1957 to get his oscar nomination as colonel saito , the sadistic camp commander . <sssss> demille also does very well with his cast of upper crust new yorkers . <sssss> the costumes are fascinating . <sssss> contrast these clothes with `` the mating call , '' which is set in that same time but costumed in the contemporary clothing of the twenties when it was filmed . <sssss> silent movies get short shrift in america , but `` the cheat '' is worth watching for a number of reasons , the best of which is sessue hayakawa .

ur2467618/		\tt0005205		5		this is an average keystone comedy made just after charlie chaplin left the studio for more money and greater fame . <sssss> after his departure , a wide variety of comedians made their mark at keystone -- including a very young charley chase . <sssss> however , even though imdb said that this film starred chase , i am not really sure if it 's him -- as the leading man seemed shorter and chubbier than chase and the other male lead is twice the size as chase . <sssss> regardless of whether or not this is him , this film when seen today is n't particularly funny . <sssss> but , for 1915 it was n't bad at all and was a heck of a lot better than many of the keystone films -lrb- including many of chaplin 's -rrb- that mostly consisted of people getting bonked on the head or kicking each other . <sssss> at least this one had a plot -- albeit a strange one . <sssss> a young rogue wants to get a young lady 's attention as she 's taking her piano lesson . <sssss> first , he steals an organ grinders instrument and monkey but that did n't work . <sssss> later , he tries to kill the instructor by rigging a bomb to the piano . <sssss> is n't it funny how in old time films they just happened to have bombs lying around ?!? <sssss> anyway , when this fails , the film has a final bizarre chase scene with a runaway piano . <sssss> funny ? <sssss> not really . <sssss> but for really funny films , the studios did n't really hit their stride for a couple more years .

ur2467618/		\tt0005812		7		charlie chaplin made an odd little short indeed ! <sssss> he plays two different characters -- neither of which are his usual `` little tramp '' . <sssss> instead , he plays two really annoying audience members at a live show . <sssss> mr. pest was a drunk rich guy who acted like he was the only one in the audience -- having no regard for others at all during the show -- even annoying the performers from time to time . <sssss> mr. rowdy was a poorer guy in the balcony who nearly fell off the balcony several times and was prone to throwing or dropping things . <sssss> together , they both helped to ruin the show . <sssss> while this is all the plot there really is in the film , it 's so much fun and there 's so much silly slapstick humor that i had a fine time . <sssss> usually i like more plot , but funny is funny .

ur45193665/		\tt0005945		10		it is well worth viewing the existing reels of this film . <sssss> mary is in her full element playing the fiery girl with a lot of spunk . <sssss> there is the right amount of humour and pathos in this film , no wonder it was a box-office smash , that led to another milestone in pickford 's career . <sssss> in the summer of 1915 , mary pickford 's new film `` rags '' was playing at the strand theatre in new york city . <sssss> on her way home from the famous players studio , she passed by the strand theatre daily , taking delight at seeing the overflow crowds , coming in and out , to see rags . <sssss> weeks later when the same theatre was playing another famous players film , she took note of the deserted sidewalks . <sssss> she even bought a ticket and was surprised to find an almost empty theatre . <sssss> it did n't take long for her astute business mind , to deduce that something was amiss . <sssss> confronting adolph zukor with these facts , she discovered that paramount , who distributed famous players films , was renting the company 's movies through a system called `` block booking '' . <sssss> so if a theatre wanted to show the popular pickford 's film , it had no choice but to take a package that included other lesser films . <sssss> mary realized her name was being used to make money on movies unable to make it on their own . <sssss> armed with all this new information , mary and her mother were ready when it came time to negotiate a new contract . <sssss> on june 24 , 1916 , she signed a new 2 year contract , to which she became the first screen actress to produce her own work , and also have the final approval over the directors and approval of the supporting actors hired for her pictures . <sssss> mary would also be required to make a maximum of six films a year . <sssss> this meant more care could be taken in producing a finer quality movie . <sssss> now her films would be distributed through , a special division of paramount , which did not . <sssss> zukor also agreed to pay mary half a million dollars a year or half the net profits of her films , whichever sum was greatest . <sssss> with all this and a bonus , and some special added perks , the press would exclaim , mary pickford was now the highest paid woman in the world . 
ur2467618/		\tt0006296		7		hummmm , ... another keystone comedy set in the park !!! <sssss> it seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park , as so many of chaplin 's and arbuckle 's films are set there ! <sssss> and , while this is yet another one , it is different enough and well made that i still enjoyed it . <sssss> fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting mabel normand . <sssss> i think she 's supposed to be a little younger , though in her mother 's eyes she is too young to be interested in men . <sssss> well , fatty does not share her feelings and soon he and mabel run away for some innocent fun . <sssss> things get complicated when the mother 's watch is stolen . <sssss> fatty finds it and gives it to mabel as a gift , ... and many problems result . <sssss> decent pacing and the fact that this movie did not rely too much on cheap slapstick but a reasonable plot make this a cute and enjoyable little film . 
ur0051285/		\tt0006333		8		this film combines plot elements of verne 's original 20,000 leagues under the sea and mysterious island , then adds its own subplot involving the origin of captain nemo that ties everything together . <sssss> i was very impressed by the writing . <sssss> this was the first major film with underwater photography . <sssss> the set design was impressive . <sssss> i found the diving suits to be particularly interesting -- essentially early versions of scuba gear . <sssss> the new score fit very well into the story . <sssss> all in all , a wonderful and landmark achievement in filmmaking . 
ur4202340/		\tt0006548		7		in a way , one could say it is curious that chaplin picked this particular title for this particular film . <sssss> true , chaplin usually named his films rather one-dimensionally , making it pretty predictable what the public was going to see . <sssss> what is curious in this case , is that he could just as well have used it to at least two of his previous efforts . <sssss> it is constructed within a situation that had been used numerous times , both on stage and in films , even before chaplin adopted it , and he would repeat it long after he went into features . <sssss> yet , i disagree with reviewers who blame it for `` unoriginality '' ; one of chaplin 's strengths was his ability to develop new variations of old routines . <sssss> in the count , his most expensive film up to this time , chaplin once again uses the contrast between rich and poor as his main foil for comic invention . <sssss> the story is told through three different sets : a tailor 's shop , a kitchen , and the home of mrs. moneybags -lrb- did i mention she 's wealthy ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> there is hardly much connection between charlie 's job at the tailor 's shop and of the later event that will lead to the climax -lrb- apart from that it gives us a slight impression that he is in possession of some consciousness as far as clothing is concerned , a strength that will prove helpful -rrb- . <sssss> story : charlie gets fired from the tailor 's shop due to incompetence ; hungry , he shuffles to the kitchen of a cook with whom he has some sort of `` affair '' ; while enjoying his meal , another visitor enters and charlie hides further into the house . <sssss> meanwhile , the tailor who previously served as his boss , appears , determined to fool everyone at a party held by moneybags that he is a count ; but charlie is quicker . <sssss> at first viewing , i did n't think that much of this . <sssss> amusing , oh yes , as all of chaplin 's films from this period , but hardly worth another look had chaplin not been the man who made it . <sssss> however , repeated viewings of films can be helpful ; being a kid like i am , i view silent comedy very differently now than i did two , three years ago . <sssss> i 've realized that there really is no need for someone to hang from a clock five stories in the air to be funny ; to study small details , notice the exact moment when charlie nonchalantly lifts his hat , and laugh because he did it at precisely that moment , can be just as intriguing . <sssss> and it is in such a category , i believe , that the count fits in . <sssss> the story is nothing exceptional because there is no need for it . <sssss> the gags speak for themselves , if you have patience for them . <sssss> lots of bits here confirm -lrb- or at least hint at -rrb- chaplin 's progression as a performer and story-teller compared to his output a few months earlier . <sssss> in his autobiography , the comedian claimed that he never included a gag if it had a disturbing effect on the story , no matter how funny it was ; a claim tempting to argue once we see the kitchen sequence . <sssss> so charlie is fired , okay , he is a tramp , after all ; but did that serve any other purpose than gaining laughs , and an excuse for charlie to make his way into the house and hence mess himself into the ? <sssss> not that gaining laughs is an unreasonable thing for a comedy to do . <sssss> but speaking of `` details , '' pay attention : when charlie enters , the female cook -lrb- well into her middle-age -rrb- reaches her hand flat , expecting a gentle kiss . <sssss> charlie returns the flirtatious behavior , prepares himself to kiss as though he was her lover , and ugh ! <sssss> -- wipes his hand on her 's in order to give the impression that the kiss was granted . <sssss> it is obvious what charlie 's affection is based on . <sssss> the cook soon disappears , but with her brief appearance , our understanding of charlie 's intentions has progressed to a considerable degree . <sssss> gone is the sympathy we felt for him at the beginning -- at least we put it to question . <sssss> charlie is willing to systematically detect the naivety of his surroundings to reach his goal ; perhaps as a result of a howling stomach , but he is clearly a man of self-assurance . <sssss> this , if nothing more , demonstrates chaplin 's consciousness as a director . <sssss> unlike his contemporaries , rather than to let his audience get puzzled in their attempt to relate to the character on screen , as the personality of these characters would vary from one film to the next , chaplin wisely gives us hints at how to view his character in context to the story , but doing so through such spontaneity that it does not kill one percent of our illusions . <sssss> as for the gags , there are plenty of bits which get hysterical because you believe you know what comes next , when you very likely do n't . <sssss> when eric campbell knocks his arm into charlie 's stomach several times to underscore that the two henceforth are a team , charlie picks a chair while eric has his attention elsewhere . <sssss> he leans his arms on it , smiling , as if to make himself comfortable . <sssss> suddenly , eric knocks his arm into charlie 's again -- and hits the chair . <sssss> the obvious way to perform this gag would be for charlie to simply do a turn and let eric fall backwards , but as he actually bothered to take a chair , lean on it passionately during a break , the eventual purpose comes as quite a surprise and is consequently very funny . <sssss> similarly , charlie and eric kicking one another in the rear is perhaps not more than mildly amusing , but the scene is hilarious nevertheless . <sssss> the hilarity is not so much due to what they do as to their reactions to it . <sssss> trying to let the party stay unaware of their fight , they attempt to maintain their dignity and behave as though everything is perfectly normal , when in fact they remind the audience of quarreling children . <sssss> through the old frames , the count offers quite a few glimpses of chaplin 's maturity as an artist . <sssss> hilarious film . 
ur2467618/		\tt0006688		9		it 's interesting today that we all know of douglas fairbanks as an action-adventure hero from movies like `` robin hood '' , `` the mark of zorro '' and `` the black pirate '' . <sssss> that 's because he also made quite a few wonderful comedies early in his career -- and they are truly some of the best of the 1910s . <sssss> he was an amazingly versatile actor and was able to use his prodigious athleticism in comedies as well . <sssss> unfortunately , there are n't a lot of examples of his comedies out there -- so you may have to dig a bit . <sssss> fortunately , `` flirting with fate '' is in the public domain and can be downloaded from a link on imdb -- and it 's well worth your time -- particularly if you are a fan of silent comedy . <sssss> the film finds fairbanks a poor painter . <sssss> while he 's very good , he has not yet been discovered . <sssss> he also has a problem because he 's infatuated with a rich young lady whose family wo n't approve of his seeing her because of his low station in life . <sssss> fortunately , he has a friend who loans him some clothes and introduces him to the girl and her family -- and perhaps they 'll like him enough to ignore his poverty . <sssss> through some very bad timing , douglas has a very bad day . <sssss> first , his lady friend thinks he 's interested in another lady and refuses to see him . <sssss> next , someone offers him a small fortune for his painting of this lady but he refuses to sell -- only to have a thief steal it from him ! <sssss> then , the money he expected to be able to borrow from a friend is not coming ... and he feels like killing himself . <sssss> he tries but is unsuccessful , so he comes up with the idea of paying a guy to murder him ! <sssss> the guy is a lowlife , so he 's thrilled to get the job and agrees to kill fairbanks . <sssss> a short time later , suddenly fairbanks life does a complete turnaround . <sssss> the mix up with the lady is resolved and she wants to marry him , the painting is found and he inherits $ 1,000,000 -- but there still is an assassin out there waiting to kill him -- even though now he is desperate to live . <sssss> it 's all very , very clever and funny and i wo n't tell you more about how it all gets resolved . <sssss> watch this one -- it is a treasure ... and as funny as anything from the comedy greats of the era . <sssss> once again , fairbanks proves he 's up there with the best of them with a great script , wonderful stunts and a great pace that keeps you watching and cheering for him . 
ur7526625/		\tt0006745		6		gretchen the greenhorn is an early silent film starring dorothy gish in the title role . <sssss> she plays a dutch girl who immigrates to america to be with her father , a man who engraves for a living . <sssss> he is swindled by a gang who tricks him into counterfeiting money for them . <sssss> although his intentions are completely pure , he hesitates to turn the gang in for fear of jail time , but the gangsters act quickly to capture him . <sssss> it is up to gretchen to save him . <sssss> this film does not have all of the action and suspense of later gangster films , nor the outstanding faces of the screen that could benefit it . <sssss> overall , it is an average film , entertaining and short enough for a night of film-watching . <sssss> although some rave about dorothy gish , i have never warmed up to her . <sssss> i thought i might in this starring role , but i still did not find her charming , beautiful , or very talented . 
ur1298724/		\tt0006809		7		considering that this movie was made 90 years ago it 's remarkably modern in several respects . <sssss> the character doug plays is the son of a highly successful businessman , a processed food magnate -lrb- possibly based on john harvey kellogg of breakfast cereal fame -rrb- whose products are widely advertised and touted for their healthy ingredients . <sssss> the early scenes poke fun at the advertising campaign and at the father , proteus prindle -- what a name ! <sssss> -- plainly suggesting that he 's more than a little pompous , and takes himself and his business too seriously . <sssss> son pete , meanwhile , is something of a good-hearted slacker . <sssss> he works for dad but shows up late at the office , and yet it 's clear that he 's no lazy slob , either : this is a young man who performs his morning exercise by leaping over his bed . <sssss> he 's played by doug fairbanks , after all . <sssss> pete rolls in late because he is n't as dedicated to the business as his old man , and perhaps because he was out sowing some wild oats the night before , but he 's not a bad sort , he just needs to find a project he cares about . <sssss> pete becomes interested in a young woman named christine -lrb- played by loretta blake -rrb- whose father is also a wealthy businessman . <sssss> this gentleman admires proteus prindle , follows prindle 's regimen , and obviously feels that pete does n't measure up to his old man 's stature . <sssss> christine 's father refuses to allow her to marry prindle jr. unless the young man demonstrates his worthiness in business . <sssss> therefore , prindle sr. sets a goal : pete must generate positive publicity for the company by getting his picture in the papers . <sssss> and so our hero launches a series of outlandish schemes designed solely to attract attention . <sssss> at first he thinks the task will be easy , but he comes to find it surprisingly difficult : he stages a fake accident , but is ignored ; he takes part in a boxing match , but it 's broken up by the authorities ; and finally he runs up against a gang of extortionist crooks who have been after christine 's father . <sssss> i do n't think it 's telling too much to report that pete ultimately saves the day , gets the publicity and wins the girl -- again , this is doug fairbanks we 're talking about . <sssss> how can he lose ? <sssss> it may seem strange to speak of a silent comedy of this vintage as `` modern '' but the satirical elements in this film , i.e. the jabs at advertising and publicity-seeking , were certainly fresh in 1916 and give the film an engagingly sassy quality today . <sssss> the filmmakers ' attitude towards prindle 's health food philosophy is also notable : clearly , they regard the old man 's vegetarianism as wimpy , while son pete 's irrepressible appetite for red meat and strong drink is presented as robustly virile . <sssss> christine , meanwhile , rejects a pallid young suitor who follows the prindle regimen . <sssss> and we learn that pete and christine are kindred spirits when it 's revealed they both pretend to enjoy health food to please their parents , but sneak out for real food -lrb- i.e. steak -rrb- afterward . <sssss> doug 's performance as a hero is still satisfying for modern viewers , although the film 's battered condition -lrb- or that of the print i saw , anyway -rrb- makes it a challenge to follow everything that 's happening . <sssss> silent cinema buffs will get a kick out of erich von stroheim 's brief turn as a thug who sports an eye-patch and attacks christine 's father . <sssss> loretta blake is rather more mature and than doug 's usual heroines ; in subsequent films his leading ladies sometimes appear to be teenagers -lrb- and they sometimes were -rrb- , but on this occasion he 's dealing with a mature woman . <sssss> miss blake is fine in the role , but one can see why fairbanks went with a different type of leading lady later on ; those wide-eyed girls seem better suited to play opposite an over-grown boy like doug . <sssss> his picture in the papers was one of fairbanks ' first star vehicles , and it marked his first collaboration with director john emerson and his wife , screenwriter anita loos . <sssss> the trio would work together with great success on comedies during the 1910s , before doug switched to swashbucklers . <sssss> this film is somewhat restrained compared to later entries , at least where action is concerned , but the satirical element keeps it surprisingly fresh and enjoyable . 
ur1888886/		\tt0006895		6		this adaptation of shakespeare 's `` king lear '' is currently available in two different versions . <sssss> the dvd from the thanhouser company film preservation is among a compilation of the films from the early thanhouser production company . <sssss> its version of the film is a two and a half reels from the original five reels and runs approximately 36 minutes . <sssss> the video was transferred from a print from the george eastman house , perhaps 35mm . <sssss> the dvd from televista appears to show the complete or near-complete film and runs approximately 63 minutes . <sssss> yet , the televista version has significantly worse picture quality , which was surely copied from a contrasty reduction print . <sssss> this situation arises occasionally , especially with the older films in the public domain . <sssss> `` a girl 's folly '' -lrb- 1917 -rrb- is available under the same situation : one version with high picture quality but an incomplete print and another version that is more complete but of lesser visual quality . <sssss> fortunately for me , i had the opportunity to view both without purchase . <sssss> i do n't see an easy choice if one were limited to one or the other in this situation . <sssss> this `` king lear '' was one of a spew of shakespeare films made for the bard 's , although shakespeare already had been for years a source for numerous screen adaptations . <sssss> some of the other 1916 films are now presumed lost : metro 's `` romeo and juliet '' starring francis x. bushman and beverly bayne , both stars at the time but now largely forgotten ; fox 's `` romeo and juliet '' with the vamp theda bara ; a `` macbeth '' featuring sir herbert tree ; and a conceptually intriguing lampooning of shakespearian acting , `` the real thing at last '' , which historian judith buchanan -lrb- `` shakespeare on silent film : an excellent dumb discourse '' -rrb- considers the most regretful lost shakespeare of the silent era . <sssss> frederick warde who plays lear here also played the title role in the early feature-length shakespeare film `` richard iii '' -lrb- 1912 -rrb- . <sssss> although he and the rest of the cast of `` king lear '' are theatrical , the acting is better suited to the screen than that which appeared in `` richard iii '' . <sssss> the comparatively closer camera views and more scene dissection in the 1916 film as opposed to the static 1912 early feature also help considerably in this respect . <sssss> overall , thanhouser 's `` king lear '' is a decent rendering of the play 's plot and is well paced , but is n't anything special . <sssss> the swordfights are rather pathetic , but better than those performed in the earlier thanhouser shakespearian photoplay `` '' -lrb- 1913 -rrb- . <sssss> some of shakespeare 's language is well used in the odd font of the intertitles . <sssss> according to buchanan , the film originally included a prologue where warde played himself reading `` king lear '' and then imagined himself in the role , thus introducing the main narrative , but this part is absent from both versions that i viewed . 
ur10879013/		\tt0007108		6		i enjoyed the mystery of the leaping fish , with who else than douglas fairbanks as coke ennyday , a burlesque comedy distinguished concomitantly by inner merits -- i.e. , as a funny burlesque , sprite and nonsensical -- and by the cast -lrb- -- the said fairbanks -- -rrb- and screenwriter -- tod browning . <sssss> coke ennyday , a detective described as a drug -- addicted himself , uncovers a band of opium smugglers , the leaping fish being a place on the beach , where coke goes to track down the smugglers ; the _ absurdism of this short burlesque requires a certain degree of sophistication . <sssss> this kind of freedom was later suppressed or molded by the mainstream audiences ' requirements . 
ur0731387/		\tt0007617		7		in this wonderful ` slapstick ' the main characters are all under the age of ten . <sssss> i think their performance is very good . <sssss> it has nice special effects and of course a nice story . <sssss> i saw the version on ` arte ' which was ok despite of the alteration of the introduction and credit titles . 
ur1388206/		\tt0007802		8		*** spoilers - if you have n't seen it yet , though , you probably are n't reading this *** a pleasant little film from ben turpin . <sssss> the tape i have with this movie on it contains several other turpin movies , and from watching them , i believe the reason he did n't achieve the fame of the great silent comics was because he never really solidified his character . <sssss> he plays a thief , a milquetoast , a masher , a victim ... other than his crossed eyes , there was nothing you could look at in his performances and say ` this is ben turpin ' . <sssss> not that turpin did n't make some funny films , mind you . <sssss> in this particular outing , he plays a janitor whose engineer associate has made a mechanical man who looks just like ben . <sssss> of course , the mistake in identity is made , and turpin spends the better part of the movie pretending to be a mechanical dummy . <sssss> this is good work ; understanding , as a viewer , that no human can totally mimic a machine -lrb- i.e. when thrown over someone 's shoulder , a real person 's arms and legs will flex to a certain extent -rrb- , you can get some good laughs out of these sequences . <sssss> ben fails to elicit a whole lot of sympathy , however , for his crush on the engineer 's girlfriend . <sssss> his act of deception in order to get more attention from her is what leads to his playing the mechanical man , and a blatant act of thievery leads to his unmasking and downfall . <sssss> a fun film ; much than a lot of sennett 's work . <sssss> relies on plot and slapstick to sell the humor . 
ur1617546/		\tt0007931		6		a surprisingly flat early offering from fairbanks . <sssss> although he displays flashes of his usual athleticism -- climbing rock walls and doing a little trick riding , as well as a bit of clowning when he pretends not to be able to ride a horse -- this is a fairly straightforward western , with the chief cattle rustler making a play for the pretty schoolmarm . <sssss> fair too much of the story is told by use of titles and there is only one or two flashes of wit in them . <sssss> of interest primarily for fairbanks fans .

ur3760974/		\tt0010323		10		in an era when artistic cinema was as new to the world as moving pictures themselves , few talents around the world dared to explore this new medium to enhance the transmission of their artistic movements . <sssss> few directors and actually dared to take the second step , and make both an entertaining ` movie picture ' as well as one that could be thoroughly analyzed and interpreted by audiences . <sssss> robert wiene is one of those , and his silent film `` das cabinet des dr. caligari . '' <sssss> is as good as silent films get ... when it comes to german silent films , at the very least . <sssss> the film was ground-breaking in every sense of the word . <sssss> combining a nightmarish and complicated plot with the artistic sensibilities of expressionism , exemplary storytelling and all the up-to-date cinema techniques , he delivers a classic for the ages . <sssss> the movie is definitely surreal and ambiguous , but if forced to find a plot , we might say that it 's about a certain dr. caligari , a nomad monk who arrives one day at a strange , exotic town where surreal shapes and settings are at the order of the day . <sssss> this quirky , sometimes terrifying man has arrived just in time for the local fair , and he asks to have his act admitted therein . <sssss> he travels with a large , rustic cabinet where the somnambulist cesare sleeps , and when dr. caligari has him awaken before an awe-struck audience , he proclaims that this somnambulist can predict the future . <sssss> meanwhile , two friends strive to grasp the attention of a lovely woman , and as they discuss how their friendship is not to be tarnished by their affections for the same woman , they are attracted to dr. caligari 's show . <sssss> one of the men , eager to have his future predicted , asks about his time of death , and -lrb- in a rivetingly taut scene -rrb- the horrifying somnambulist declares that he is to die at dawn . <sssss> the man is murdered at dawn precisely , and when his friend tries futilely to find the murderer , the connection is made to the somnambulist 's prediction . <sssss> what follows is a deeply engrossing story with various unexpected twists and turns that shed some doubt not only into the identity of the murderer -lrb- who seems to have gone on a killing spree -rrb- but on the sanity of all characters involved . <sssss> this is pure entertainment in nightmare form , and it is one of the first horror films -lrb- if it can be called that -rrb- that ever existed . <sssss> the most memorable aspect of the film are the settings , of course . <sssss> a gamma of twisted , surreal buildings and settings set the example for future directors such as tim burton , jean-pierre jeunet , andy warhol and guillermo del toro . <sssss> it gives the impression of a twisted dream we 've entered , and it helps greatly with the dark , ominous mood of the story . <sssss> as i 've mentioned before , these aesthetics personify cinematic expressionism , and are a paramount in production design nowadays . <sssss> the images linger with you even after the film has ended , and you feel as if you 've just experienced something unnatural and mildly disturbing ... but also something darkly enchanting you 're willing to revisit over and over again . <sssss> the melodrama is , of course , overacted like hell , but this is a silent movie after all , and were it not overacted we would n't have a clue as to what 's going on . <sssss> that 's another interesting aspect about the film . <sssss> it does n't rely too much on the words on the black screens to carry the plot . <sssss> in fact , the words merely state facts and certain important phrases , but we are left to discern emotions and personalities from the actions of the characters alone . <sssss> it 's simply incredible ! <sssss> this was made in 1920 , but the character development and the way it probes into the human subconscious rivals that of any other screenplay nowadays . <sssss> the cinematography is also another interesting thing to ponder about . <sssss> the film is dark -lrb- in every sense of the word -rrb- , and instead of playing with shadows , dark corridors and lonely passages -lrb- like most scary films -rrb- , the camera feels perpetually darkened , as if the entire town were forever steeped in obscurity . <sssss> even the daylight scenes are mysterious and dim . <sssss> the music , which sounds like a combination between a thriller score and a distorted circus background tune , deals even more tension and lack of comfort to the plot . <sssss> in addition , there are countless fade-ins and fade-outs , and various segments of the scenes are filmed as through a peephole , giving us the impression that we 're submerged in loneliness and darkness while peeking into someone else 's nightmare . <sssss> this is a perfect film . <sssss> 89 years ago it was breath-taking , compelling and overly dramatic . <sssss> now , in 2009 , it still holds an urgency , a `` '' that can still enthrall you , and you become so engrossed in the plot that the occasional black screen with words , the comical rapid movement captured by those old cameras and the almost hysterical overacting never seem to become a flaw , but part of the enchantment of the film . <sssss> and as to the artistic interpretations of the scenes , the geometrical of the events and the setting may have a whole load of explanations ... but those , as in every work of art , are open to the sensibilities of the viewer . <sssss> watch this ! <sssss> if you love silent films , you 'll adore this one . <sssss> if you do n't , you might just change your mind . <sssss> and if you 're looking to be introduced into this genre , this is a perfect place to start . <sssss> rating : 4 stars out of 4 !!

ur23465994/		\tt0010323		9		robert wiene 's 1920 classic is one of the main representatives of german expressionism , a movement that revolutionized film-making , and has influenced many later masters of the world cinema . <sssss> we see here a different type of cinema than we are used to , different even for the standards of the time . <sssss> the relatively new medium is seen as a chance to present a work of art which does not try to imitate reality , but where reality is interpreted through the artistic models of the expressionism . <sssss> in order to antagonize hollywood 's hegemony , the art directors convinced the producers to realize a film which interpreted cinema as a new medium , where different artistic disciplines could converge , and not just a glorified narration , as it generally was customary across the ocean . <sssss> the result is the depiction of a world of wonky houses , angled roads , and sinister characters , and the effect is beautiful , very expressive , full of symbols and allusions , and definitely a novelty for that period . <sssss> the avant-garde arts had arrived to the movie screens too , in the end , and the results achieved here could not be ignored ever again . <sssss> so strong was the impact this film had , on audience and insiders alike , that many later directors drew inspiration from caligari for their work . <sssss> let 's think about hitchcock for instance , or tim burton , or the american film noir of the 40s and 50s , and also to all the other genres or directors who were inspired by caligari 's themes and visual mise-en-scene . <sssss> the plot revolves around the figure of stage magician dr caligari , and his dreadful slave , cesare the somnambulist . <sssss> they arrive into town for the big exotic fair , and strange events start to happen ; are they somehow connected to this ? <sssss> this film is bound to fill any theatre where it might be shown , counting hordes of supporters and lovers , and rightly so . <sssss> it is silent cinema at its best !

as well as the great protagonist nature with its rain , shadows , lights ... this german count have to say , that even though the copy that has survived it is not a complete one due to some missing sequence but thanks to herr mayer 's hand written script , these sequences have been able to survive through the literature for the total enjoyment of this genius german director 's master piece . <sssss> the perfect combination between herr mayer and herr murnau 's work produced memorable scenes in this great film work . <sssss> let 's start pointing out the arrival of the blind painter to the town : he arrives in a boat , standing in it , between the shadows , powerfully showing off his silhouette where the sky meets the sea which forms the plane suggesting a strong presence , a ghostly one . <sssss> we see lily . <sssss> who is saying goodbye to her husband who 's off to visit his patients , observing the painter getting close to her door and she follows him during his passage with a mix of surprise and fascination , foreshadowing the fact that the happiness reigning in the house until then will be threatened , because something has seduced dame lily in a subtle and irremediable way . <sssss> equally magnificent is the scene that will establish herr eigil 's betrayal . <sssss> the doctor removes the bandages covering his face at 6 pm . <sssss> lily fears that once the painter recovers his vision , her secret love will be hard to hide . <sssss> it is shown in an exceptional montage when the time approaches , the sea , which was calm until now , starts to become turbulent foretelling that the event that was thought to be a happy one , will have fatal consequences for the married couple . <sssss> herr murnau will return to the same initial plane as when the blind painter arrived in the town , but this time with the doctor as the main character who has come from visiting his old girlfriend who is agonizing from the pain caused by the unexpected and quick break up from her former but still loved fiancée . <sssss> the same threatening sensation of unexpected arrival will alert the spectator this time to know that terrible things await the doctor . <sssss> when he finally discovers his wife 's deceit , the irate doctor will get away by running from the cliff where he found them , cursing his fate , and again the quiet and calm weather that the adulterous couple had before , will transform into a threatening storm . <sssss> nature is again an important character for the film , for a story that needs to explain the human frustrations , those disappointments that his characters go through the film in an earthy and archaic way . <sssss> there are inter titles in the movie that are really beautiful , full of that poetry that you can find in all of herr murnau 's work . <sssss> let 's remember anyway that the german director thought that inter titles were not necessary to tell a story because the images , by themselves , had to carry the protagonist with the seducing power to tell the stories without `` explanatory subtitles '' . <sssss> however , it is well known that during his first period , murnau used these inter titles very often counting on them to inform in different ways his stories , affirming specially the characters ' feelings , thoughts and sensations . <sssss> for example , during a scene of the first visit from the doctor to the blind painter , he will be seated in his garden `` looking '' at a canvas ; when the doctor stops next to him , he says : `` a prayer for the grace of sight '' . <sssss> all the drama , suffering and hopes of the tormented painter stay perfectly exposed , giving much more strength to the images . <sssss> the biggest drama and beauty is in the final inter title , where the painter , blind again and with his lover dead , writes a note to his friend , his former doctor , saying : `` i do n't blame you . <sssss> nobody is guilty . <sssss> the law -lrb- god 's -rrb- is above us all . <sssss> but you shall not cure me again . <sssss> you gave me a gift of light and i could see her . <sssss> now i come back again to my night .

ur2467618/		\tt0011841		8		the reason i say that way down east is a very good film for 1920 is that even by the mid-1920s , the style film this is would probably have seemed a bit old fashioned . <sssss> so , compared to late silents it 's not a great movie by any stretch but it is a decent movie nonetheless and better than most films of the day . <sssss> so why is it old fashioned ? <sssss> well , like the characters in many of the earlier d.w. griffith films , the in the movie often seem very one-dimensional -- like a 19th century morality play . <sssss> for example , lillian gish plays a wonderful virginal sort , there is the town tattletale , the judgmental man , the cad and the professor -- all stereotypes instead of real people . <sssss> but despite all this , it still is a very good film . <sssss> way down east begins with a poor cousin -lrb- lillian gish -rrb- going to the big city to spend time with her rich relatives . <sssss> at this home , she is spotted by a total cad -lrb- lowell sherman -rrb- and he eventually asks her to marry him . <sssss> however , the marriage is fake -- and gish has no idea it 's not legal . <sssss> after getting her pregnant , sherman runs away -- leaving her to have the baby on her own . <sssss> soon the baby dies and gish is forced to go look for work in another town . <sssss> there she gets work as a maid and becomes a beloved member of the family -- that is , until word gets to the townsfolk that gish is `` that kind of woman '' ! <sssss> this leads to an amazingly climactic scene on the ice -lrb- reminscent of the video game `` frogger '' -rrb- that you just have to see to believe and it 's one of the best scenes griffith ever filmed -- very tense and amazing even when seen almost 90 years later . <sssss> what 's to like about the film ? <sssss> well , the biggest star of the movie are the special effects and camera work . <sssss> as mentioned above , the ice scene is simply amazing , though the snow storm is also very realistic and well done . <sssss> also , there were some very lovely camera shots -- such as the scene by the lake . <sssss> all these made this a first-class project . <sssss> overall , this is an important film but one that i would recommend mostly to people who already love silents . <sssss> they will enjoy it considerably . <sssss> however , for people not accustomed to and appreciative of the silents , it 's probably one to hold off on -- as you may be too quick to dismiss it because of the preachy plot and one-dimensional characters . <sssss> for 1920 , it was quite the accomplishment . 
ur5037232/		\tt0011841		9		d.w griffith 's outstanding ` way down east ' is one of the best films produced by america in the silent era . <sssss> it is a monument to epic film-making , and the talents of it 's director , griffith , and it 's star , the great lillian gish . <sssss> in a plot very similar to that of thomas hardy 's famous novel ` tess of the d'urbervilles ' , gish portrays anna moore , a poor farm girl who must leave her relatives in search of assistance from her rich city cousins . <sssss> upon arrival it is obvious that she is in an unfamiliar , dangerous world with these wealthy , pleasure-seeking people - just look at the juxtaposition of anna 's costume at the party , and the over-sized door that both greets and dwarfs her . <sssss> anna meets the cad lennox sanderson at said party given by her relatives , and the villain seduces the innocent girl . <sssss> lennox tricks her into a fake wedding in order to bed her . <sssss> anna is shocked to find out later the wickedness of his deeds . <sssss> she returns home to her family a disgraced , pregnant single woman . <sssss> she is cast aside by her relatives and her weakling baby dies . <sssss> finally , she must take to the road in search of help . <sssss> on the bartlett family farm she finds salvation , and a man that could be true to her , the idealistic dreamer son david -lrb- richard barthelmess -rrb- . <sssss> but escaping the past will prove difficult for if she is to achieve happiness in the end . <sssss> gish is absolutely brilliant in the role of the poor , simple farm girl . <sssss> she was the first truly ` modern ' actress of the cinema , and she shows her talent here , running through the gamut of emotions and looking achingly torn in every beautiful close-up . <sssss> no posturing like we saw from silent exotics pola negri or theda bara , gish is truly natural . <sssss> their was no one better than her at the playing the suffering , betrayed girl in the d.w griffith victorian melodramas . <sssss> perhaps her position as a symbolic of victorian purity and virtue is the reason her film career in the talkies was largely reduced . <sssss> gish still had a successful film and television career in character parts for many , many years after the induction of sound , but her silent work will always be her lasting contribution . <sssss> richard barthelmess , who gish regarded as the best-looking man ever to grace the screen , gives an equally fine performance as david . <sssss> he is the sweet lover we all would like to have , honest and true . <sssss> the love scenes between david and anna are tender and believable , lillian and richard certainly shared remarkable chemistry . <sssss> i love how d.w made this film ; the filmic devices he employed . <sssss> wonderful symbolism with david stroking a white dove , another image of purity . <sssss> the pastoral images bathed in natural light contrasted with the darkness of anna 's ` seduction ' . <sssss> the juxtaposition of the rich and poor . <sssss> the light comic relief in the midst of drama . <sssss> oh , and that ` ' scene . <sssss> that scene is one of the most remarkable you will find in the cinema , and it was shot entirely on location . <sssss> yes , that is miss gish 's freezing hand dragging in the ice , and barthelmess was the one who rescued gish from certain peril . <sssss> remember , these were the days where actors did their own stunts , so kudos all round . <sssss> this film is a true example of . <sssss> i actually studied it in-depth in school last year as a film , and it 's not hard to see it 's place as one . <sssss> the treatment of women -lrb- unmarried mothers -rrb- is revelatory , the image of the ` seducer ' figure is prominent , and the divide between the rich and poor is clearly evident . <sssss> yes , it 's almost like picking up one of those hefty victorian novels , a viewing of . <sssss> it is not without it 's faults , however . <sssss> it 's gloriously over-long and melodramatic , such was griffith 's style . <sssss> also , the moralizing can get really tedious at times . <sssss> you have to appreciate the context griffith made in this in , and griffith 's unique reputation as a film-maker to properly enjoy . <sssss> it is a marvelous experience . <sssss> 9/10 .

ur4260454/		\tt0012938		9		this movie astounded me . <sssss> something of this age should probably be tedious or dull , but not once did i feel bored -- quite the opposite in fact . <sssss> it really touched me deeply and as someone who is n't such a huge fan of romance or silent films , that 's saying something . <sssss> then again , my experience in silent films is limited mostly to lassie , some western , and fatty arbuckle comedies . <sssss> i suppose this is a sign that i should watch more . <sssss> gloria swanson and rudolph valentino had such amazing chemistry . <sssss> the tragic love between theodora and hector is so palpable . <sssss> but it is n't just the young lovers who shine in their roles . <sssss> robert bolder as josiah brown was deeply affecting in his acting . <sssss> originally , we are less than sympathetic to josiah and that is how it 's supposed to be ! <sssss> but josiah is so much deeper than he first appears : a man we initially mistook for a villain of sorts is as sensitive and caring as the woman he loves . <sssss> his sympathy towards the egyptian girl shows us that he sees himself as we had seen first seen him and at the same time proves to us that he is not the man we had mistaken him for . <sssss> it was an oddly noble part from what was believed to be a very ignoble character and that alone made the film all the more sweeter . <sssss> his death and his blessing for theodora and hector come in the same swift moment . <sssss> it is a very powerful scene and even as we know he has died , we still sit on edge , hoping against hope and knowing it 's not so . <sssss> his death enables his beloved theodora to find the happiness she had given up on . <sssss> i do n't mean to offend fans of contemporary film when i say this , but i have n't felt so touched by a character death in years . <sssss> the musical composition also lends its part into making this a masterpiece . <sssss> the lilting , almost haunting tune that guides us through the events of this film sets a mood that is undeniably seductive to us all . <sssss> it pulls you in and moves you to the edge of your seat with the suspense it evokes . <sssss> it deepens the experience so much , despite the clashing setting of 1920s england . <sssss> although i do not consider the sections of the film where it is so dissolved with age and tear to be bad , there are other things that make me hold back from the full ten stars . <sssss> gloria swanson in particular is much too made up even when portraying a young girl . <sssss> she is far more prettier than the heavily made-up portrayal of theodora . <sssss> i felt the attempt to make her look girlish was practically unbearable and her true beauty was dulled under a layer of the dark black . <sssss> the shame ! <sssss> the text was also a bit of a mistake in my opinion . <sssss> it felt far too modern and never fit in with the film itself . <sssss> times new roman or another font would have suited better . <sssss> still a great movie and even suitable for younger viewers . 
ur5232724/		\tt0013158		9		i saw the kino video transfer of this which came with an introduction that explained that it was incomplete and that most of it is pretty much destroyed . <sssss> so i did n't really get the whole short , but what i did get i shall comment on . <sssss> the plot , as it were , is hard to connect because of the missing pieces , but in general it involves keaton as a very different character than most of his films : this time , as a daringly evil but tragically incompetent ... somebody ... that goes around shooting people and chasing women when he 's not falling through snow and into frozen lakes . <sssss> it 's quite darker and drier than most of his stuff , as the keaton goes along shooting and killing person after person ... definitely not his usual stuff . <sssss> i liked the parodies and take-offs he did in this . <sssss> it was quite funny , the little pokes at melodrama from hart 's work and so on . <sssss> however , i 'd still like to see a complete copy so that i could get an idea on how this movie flows . <sssss> -- polarisdib

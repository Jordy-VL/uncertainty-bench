ur1609079/		\tt0000001		7		here 's a perfect example of the pitfalls of writing about films : especially films from the earliest days of the cinema . <sssss> the other imdb ` ers who have posted reviews of carmencita 's performance for thomas edison 's kinetograph camera are apparently reviewing footage from edison motion picture # 28 , which has been reissued on dvd as part of `` edison : the invention of the movies '' . <sssss> well , i am likewise reviewing carmencita 's performance for edison 's kinetograph . <sssss> however , the performance i saw -lrb- and which i 'm reviewing -rrb- was a different performance by the same dancer , filmed on the same occasion -- the second week of march 1894 -- but photographed on a different negative and not included in the dvd . <sssss> i saw this film -lrb- the one i 'm reviewing , mind -rrb- in october 2006 at the cinema muto festival in sacile , italy . <sssss> the print screened at sacile was retrieved from the national fairground archive in sheffield , england . <sssss> -lrb- dickson , who shot many films for edison , was an englishman ; he shipped prints of many of his edison films to britain . <sssss> -rrb- when the sheffield print was found , it was at first assumed to be one more copy of the existing carmencita footage -lrb- the one on the dvd -rrb- . <sssss> however , after restoration , it was discovered that this was a ` lost ' movie which no living person knew had ever existed in the first place : a completely different take of carmencita 's performance , differing significantly from the ` known ' version . <sssss> since edison 's catalogue lists only one version , this ` lost ' film has been provisionally titled `` carmencita # 2 '' and catalogued as emp . <sssss> this is certainly not a ` belly dance ' , despite a previous imdb ` er 's comment . <sssss> carmencita 's performance here is virtually identical to the one in the dvd version , with one interesting difference : in the version found at sheffield and screened at sacile -lrb- the one i saw -rrb- , the señorita concludes her performance by to the camera -lrb- or to its operator ? <sssss> -rrb- and offering a . <sssss> frame-by-frame comparisons make it clear that these are two separate ` takes ' : two completely different pieces of footage of the same dancer giving similar but not identical performances . <sssss> i 'd be keen to learn which one was shot first . <sssss> carmencita 's acknowledgment in the sheffield version might imply that this was the conclusion of her performance , therefore the final take . <sssss> or perhaps this was her first take , and dickson may have felt that carmencita 's gesture -- appropriate enough for a live audience watching a stage performance -- was inappropriate for a movie , and he required her to do a retake . <sssss> barring for a trip to march 1894 -lrb- grease up the ! <sssss> -rrb- , it 's unlikely that anyone will ever know which version was shot first . <sssss> on its own merits as an historic artefact , i 'll rate `` carmencita # 2 '' 6 points out of 10 ... plus one point extra -lrb- 7 total -rrb- because this film and its twin sister -- placed side by side -- serve as a caution to those who would review old-time movies , or who would criticise other reviewers ' film scholarship : sometimes the version which you saw , and the version which i saw , really are not the same movie !

ur0179921/		\tt0000439		6		this 15-minute film is obviously a pioneer of a medium new to the turn-of-the-century world and i was impressed with the innovation of for the time period . <sssss> the shot set-ups for many scenes helped to make the picture more exciting considering that the camera would not be moved during shooting . <sssss> for instance there are scenes filmed from on top a moving train and from a forest road where bandits and their pursuers gallop toward the camera 's positions while firing at each other . <sssss> early movies before this were not nearly as innovative in setting up shots , even as basic as they seem to us now almost a century later . <sssss> i commend this movie also in attempting stunts and fight scenes . <sssss> i had to laugh though when a bandit is fighting a engineer on top of the locomotive car roof and once he beats him unconscious the live victim is replaced with a stuffed man-sized dummy and thrown overboard with a casual fling by his abuser . <sssss> also , the bandits make what i thought to be a very clean getaway far ahead of any possible pursuer -lrb- commandeer a locomotive engine to the mountains , flee on foot into the mountain woodlands , meet up with their waiting horses -rrb- but somehow the posse heroes catch up with them the very next scene from belatedly finding out about the train robbery the bandits pulled off . <sssss> anyway , it was an interesting and unintentionally amusing film . <sssss> far more exciting than all the other turn-of-the-century films i 've seen on the library of congress website -lrb- -rrb- .

ur2467618/		\tt0000469		4		okay , in 1903 this must have been considered a pretty good film . <sssss> back then , many of the films lasted only a minute or two and consisted of very mundane everyday activities -- hence this dull film about a little girl feeding her sick cat . <sssss> however , unlike many of the other raters , i still can not rate this movie any higher than a 4 because there actually were good films with plot , sets , acting and imaginative camera-work that should be elevated far above the boring drivel that was flooding the . <sssss> georges méliès ' films -lrb- not just his very famous le voyage dans le lune -rrb- were head and shoulders above the dull fare of the day . <sssss> and this cat film is certainly one of those dull -lrb- but rather sweet -rrb- films .

ur2467618/		\tt0000749		3		historically this is an important film as you get a chance to see d. w. griffith as an actor before he became the world famous director . <sssss> this is interesting indeed . <sssss> unfortunately , the film itself is pretty trite and silly and lasts only about five minutes . <sssss> a little child is stolen by an obviously fake eagle that flaps its wings in very slow motion and it 's up to the family to come to her rescue . <sssss> they scale the cliff and find the child but are attacked by the stuffed bird -- at which point our hero beats it to submission and triumphs unscathed . <sssss> by today 's standards this is a piece of crap film . <sssss> however , back in 1908 , this was a typical short film . <sssss> decent movies with higher production values and plots were still in the future ! <sssss> today , though , the movie only provides a unintended few laughs ! 
ur26667112/		\tt0001013		8		`` the redman 's view is self-evidently based on a premise with indians ; griffith utilized obscure and rather nondescript actors to portray the indians . <sssss> this was seminal in his oeuvre chiefly because he skillfully used this premise for a lot his movies ranging from about 40 ; the camera angles subject you to the focal indian tribe , so it does n't badger them in this instance . <sssss> we get an exploration into the idiosyncrasies of the indian characters - one example being of how their old relatives are treated before they die ; this scene is nearly visually similar to `` birth of a nation '' where the clan are domineering menacingly over a victim -lrb- you 'll find it on google images or ebert 's review of it -rrb- . <sssss> owe moore and james kirkwood play silver eagle and his father and lottie pickford plays the embattled ; it initially chronicles on their state until it all blows out into the now conventional battle of western culture and indian culture as we have seen in john ford 's `` the searchers '' and generally in folklore . <sssss> griffith uses atmosphere to the best of his advantage , imbuing it through the setting of a desert and flowing it with the sense of perspiration and pain ; although not the way it 's channeled today as it 's counterproductive from these standards . <sssss> on its merits imagine in 1909 being swooped away into such a place ? <sssss> it 's not my favourite biograph but i still think it should be recognised for its manipulation of cult wars . <sssss> apart from that it 's an experience !

ur4445210/		\tt0002082		4		this was a pretty boring silent film short , one which the simple story moved slowly . <sssss> it 's hard to imagine a 15-18 minute movie dragging on , but that was the case here . <sssss> it 's a story of a `` weakling '' brother , as described in the title cards , who thinks he killed his big brother . <sssss> as he leaves the room in a mild panic state , a burglar comes into the house and the weakling hides . <sssss> soon , he locks the crook in the room and races to get the police , blaming the supposed death of his brother on him ! <sssss> in the end , however , justice prevails and the sappy brothers is rehabilitated by his brother 's forgiveness . <sssss> i appreciate the nice story of forgiveness , but the ridiculous part of the story is that the brother - along with four cops later on - does n't know the man is alive ? <sssss> he takes his pulse and listens to his heart ... and still thinks he 's dead ?? <sssss> the cops , too ?? <sssss> come on ! <sssss> surely , one of the five could hear a heartbeat or hear the man breathing . <sssss> lionel barrymore plays the older brother -lrb- the forgiving one -rrb- and henry b. walthall is the `` weakling .

ur45193665/		\tt0002391		10		mary pickford had been toying with the idea of going back to live theatre , and after one of her quarrels with d.w griffith , she made the decision to go back . <sssss> she called up william dean , the manager for david belasco , and a surprised william told her they had been hunting all over for her . <sssss> in a shamed voice she told him , `` i 've been in motion pictures '' . <sssss> she immediately went to the theatre and asked her if she could remove the hairpins from her hair , allowing her curls to fall loose , as a surprise for belasco . <sssss> surprised and pleased he was , and told her he wanted her for the part of the blind juliet , the leading role in `` a good little devil '' . <sssss> thrilled , she raced back to the biograph company and broke the rule of interrupting griffith at rehearsal time . <sssss> annoyed he told her to wait , but she blurted out she had to start rehearsals for a play on monday . <sssss> with tears in his eyes , griffith asked if she would make one more picture for him . <sssss> the story 's topic is so typical of griffith , and was a lovely send-off film for mary , as she responded with one of her best skillfully , understated and perfectly natural performances in `` the new york hat '' . <sssss> lionel barrymore gives an equally charming and sympathetic performance . <sssss> the , mae marsh and bobby harron were also in the cast , but are hard to find as the spotlight focuses entirely on pickford . <sssss> the film is slickly edited and there are many extensive closeups . <sssss> `` the new york hat '' is a perfectly pleasurable film to watch and a must see for fans of early silent cinema .

ur2398062/		\tt0003662		4		elderbush was a big disappointment for me . <sssss> i 'd heared how great it was , how important it was . <sssss> it just did n't strike me . <sssss> it had a dim-witted story line , plus some moronic and sadistic native american characters that are offensive by today 's standards . <sssss> while most of d.w. griffith 's films have depth and , this one feels more like a programme picture . <sssss> i loved seeing lillian gish and mae marsh in of a nation roles , plus some of the staging of the battle scenes were pretty good . <sssss> to future griffith cameraman karl brown , audiences were standing on their seats and cheering once the cavalry comes riding in at the end . <sssss> i felt nothing . <sssss> and me , i watching griffith 's early work at biograph . <sssss> this film just is n't what it used to be . <sssss> the best thing about this film it that , for all of it 's flaws , it has many of griffith 's touches to it . <sssss> he handles his principal actors pretty well , plus the scene where the indians are encircling the cabin it reminiscent to the climax of birth of a nation , a far superior film that would send shock waves across america a little over a year later .

ur2467618/		\tt0004102		7		this is an early chaplin short . <sssss> almost all of his earliest films from 1914-1915 were plot less and pretty incoherent . <sssss> however , considering the generally poor quality of films of the time , they were adored by the public . <sssss> it was only a few years later that chaplin 's films began to be great works of art -- with real scripts , higher production values and some coherence . <sssss> this film is one of chaplin 's earliest . <sssss> and , considering how early it was made , it 's surprising how much plot there actually is . <sssss> charlie is a caveman in a land where there are 1000 women for every man . <sssss> he defeats the leader of the tribe and becomes king . <sssss> later , when the old king returns and bonks charlie on the head , he awakens in the present as a cop is hitting him over the head with a club . <sssss> apparently it was all a silly dream . <sssss> the film had a few cute moments , but only a few . <sssss> not a terrible film when compared to the fare of the day , but pretty skipable despite having a very unusual plot . 
ur10489484/		\tt0004181		4		since it is easter time , herr graf 's curiosity about strange christians ' pious habits led to a decision to watch a film inspired lightly by or based on religious scenes -lrb- although aristocrats do n't share any christian feelings about their fellow men at this time or any other time of the year -rrb- . <sssss> for this reason `` judith of bethulia '' was chosen , a film located in bethulia , a village near jerusalem , so it was perfect penance for this german aristocrat . <sssss> `` judith of bethulia '' was the last film directed by herr d.w. griffith for `` biograph studios '' because the american director had a strange idea about how many reels were necessary to depict a story , an opinion about film running time that the company did n't share -lrb- afterwards herr griffith would take revenge and put his theory in practice in his well-known and longer silent films -rrb- . <sssss> the film is the story of damen judith , a widower who , in order to save her city from the assyrian invaders and the thirst and famine that her countrymen suffer in the besieged city , sacrifices her virtue to herr holofernes , the invading leader . <sssss> `` judith of bethulia '' is a film in which the techniques are recognizable which made the american director famous in the silent world , even though this film exposes them in a subtle way : not forgetting the pace , the perfectly entwined shots and situations , the strong male characters that herr griffith was so fond of , and the fragile and self-sacrificing little so characteristic of his cinema . <sssss> this film is not remarkable but perfect -lrb- clean , even antiseptic -rrb- in its technical , formal and performing aspects . <sssss> and now , if you 'll allow me , i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must sacrifice himself to one of his devoted fat german heiresses . <sssss> herr graf ferdinand von galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/

ur1888886/		\tt0004457		4		`` the patchwork girl of oz '' is one of the three oz films produced by author l. frank baum 's own production company . <sssss> and , as to be expected , it 's childish for sure . <sssss> supposedly , there 's humor in characters jumping around and moving about erratically . <sssss> violet macmillan plays a munchkin boy , but is very obviously a woman . <sssss> additionally , the static shots from a stationary camera make it a typically primitive film from 1914 . <sssss> but , there is also some inventive fantasy design -- in the story , its odd places and characters , the costumes -lrb- even the silly animal ones -rrb- and the sets . <sssss> the trick shots , such as stop-motion animation , are very basic , even for 1914 , but nothing more was needed . <sssss> children of today could still probably have fun watching this , but even for adults addicted to silent films , like myself , it may be too childish . <sssss> yet , they transferred the fantasy from the book very well and that made it worth a look for me . <sssss> and , the film 's faithfulness to the book should n't be in question , as baum worked on this adaptation himself . <sssss> it 's also interesting how far back children 's movies and fantasies go in film history . <sssss> it 's been sometime since i saw the two follow-ups to this film : `` the magic cloak of oz '' and `` his majesty , the scarecrow of oz '' , but i remember them as more of the same .

ur12938935/		\tt0005078		9		`` the cheat '' was not what i expected it to be . <sssss> i have seen enough silent movies to realise most would knock the socks off most movies of today , but noticing fannie ward was the star , i actually thought it was going to be `` creaky '' - how wrong i was . <sssss> fannie ward was an odd star whose career had petered out by the early twenties . <sssss> her main claim to fame was her youthful appearance - and she milked it for all it was worth , being known as `` the youth girl '' . <sssss> she was already in her mid 40s when demille convinced her to star in `` the cheat '' . <sssss> she had been in vaudeville and was known primarily as a comedienne but wanted to show she could be a dramatic actress . <sssss> i thought it was going to be a stuffy society drama but it was anything but . <sssss> most movie goers , by 1915 , were familiar with `` mob scenes '' but as one reviewer of a prestigious magazine claimed , demille 's court room mob scene was one of the most realistic ever filmed . <sssss> laka arakau -lrb- sessue hayakawa -rrb- is a burmese ivory trader and the latest darling of the smart set . <sssss> edith hardy -lrb- fannie ward -rrb- is a socialite who is sending her husband broke . <sssss> she neglects to pay the servants , she is openly consorting with arakau and to top it off she is the treasurer of the red cross . <sssss> when edith gets a tip about united copper stock , she decides to use the treasury funds to invest with . <sssss> of course the company goes bust and edith is forced to turn to laka to borrow money to replace the funds . <sssss> he agrees to her request but only if she will become his ... !! <sssss> the same day her husband 's shares come through and he happily gives her $ 10,000 to cover her `` bridge '' debts . <sssss> of course laka does n't want the money - he wants to be paid as he originally intended . <sssss> all edith 's histrionics do not sway him and in a highly dramatic scene he brands her and she in turn shoots him . <sssss> edith escapes but her husband , who has secretly followed her there takes the blame and the papers the next day blaze with the society murder story . <sssss> sessue hayakawa 's understated acting and smoldering good looks are extremely apparent in the court room scene - everyone around him are acting their hearts out but he says more with his eyes and raised eyebrows than all of them put together . <sssss> the mob scene was extraordinary - so was the blatant racism . <sssss> in the last scene , as edith and her husband walk out of the court to lots of back , they are now heroes . <sssss> why ? <sssss> because they have triumphed over an oriental - it was a victory for the white man . <sssss> it left a nasty taste in my mouth . 
ur2483625/		\tt0005078		5		my thought after seeing the cheat early this morning is what if this film were remade today , how would we deal with the issue of racism which this film is saturated with . <sssss> fannie ward , white and rich society woman , loses her charity 's funds gambling and to cover the loss she borrows $ 10,000.00 from a rich burmese merchant sessue hayakawa . <sssss> hayakawa 's deal however is that ward give herself over to him because he 's got a yen for white women . <sssss> later on her husband makes a killing in the market and she gets the money to pay him back . <sssss> but hayakawa 's not interested in the money once the time limit is up , he wants her in the sack . <sssss> when she refuses , he takes a branding iron and she is now branded a cheat . <sssss> ward shoots and wounds hayakawa in a struggle with her husband 's gun and the husband is arrested and stands trial for the attempted murder . <sssss> now i count in this melodrama strains from the merchant of venice , indecent proposal with a little fu manchu tossed in for the oriental flavor . <sssss> it 's a pretty scary film , especially the ending which i ca n't reveal , but remember this is the era that saw the birth of a nation as a big hit . <sssss> the yellow peril it was called back then , racism ran rampant on our west coast against chinese and japanese immigrants . <sssss> the cheat was one of cecil b. demille 's biggest silent screen hits and it made sessue hayakawa a star in the silent screen era . <sssss> when talkies came in hayakawa went to europe and later to japan during the thirties . <sssss> he resumed his career in american films in humphrey bogart 's tokyo joe and it reached the high point when he got that academy award nomination for best supporting actor for the bridge on the river kwai . <sssss> what hayakawa endured was in many ways the same as what black players did in playing their stereotypical characters . <sssss> i wonder what he must have thought of the cheat in his old age . <sssss> demille made some really good use of the camera with the expressions on ward and hayakawa 's faces telling more of the story than the title cards . <sssss> jack dean who was ward 's husband in real life as well plays the stereotypical victorian gentleman . <sssss> still the powerful racist message of this film is maybe even more vile than the birth of a nation . 
ur1048771/		\tt0005078		5		the cheat is interesting only from the standpoint that it 's an early silent film from cecil b. demille and the fact that the most realistic performance is given by japanese actor sessue hayakawa , famous now for his work in films like the bridge on the river kwai . <sssss> even at a young age , he could give glowering glances like no other , saying more with his facial expressions than any dialog could convey . <sssss> the rest of the cast indulges in broad , silent screen style of acting that sometimes borders on the ludicrous , but hayakawa is restrained in technique and yet powerful . <sssss> the story is the old chestnut about a wife who is forced to cheat on her husband and then -- to save herself from a fate worse than death -- she 's forced to shoot the man who humiliates her by branding her as his property . <sssss> she saves her virtue but her adoring husband takes the blame for her crime , which leads toward an explosive courtroom climax where cecil b. demille lets his overabundance of energy show itself in a rowdy , overpopulated courtroom where the frenzied crowd reacts to her sobbing confession . <sssss> fans of silent films will probably relish this one -- but others have to beware . <sssss> as for the fashions of 1915 , they have to be the ugliest clothes women ever wore in an effort to look elegant . <sssss> you have to see the film to know what i mean . 
ur0738625/		\tt0005149		7		the simple and , by now , oft-told tale of a son who fears that he can not live up to the high standards of his father may have been fresher in 1915 than it seems today . <sssss> however , viewers of early silent films should put themselves into the perspective of the times and relish a civil war story that was filmed while many in the audience could still remember the actual war . <sssss> the civil war took place only 50 years before `` the coward '' was made , which is approximately the same time span between world war ii and `` saving private ryan . '' <sssss> a charles ray portrays frank winslow , the son of a proud and unyielding southern gentleman , and his performance is the most naturalistic of the small cast . <sssss> a handsome young man with an appropriately innocent demeanor , ray manages to convey his ambivalence about resisting enlistment in the confederate army , a move that will alienate him from his stern father , who insists that his son uphold the family honor . <sssss> bowing to his father 's orders and threats , the young man joins the army , where he makes a fateful decision . <sssss> although subsequent events play out as anyone could predict , viewer interest never lags because the film is tight and decently paced . <sssss> unfortunately , much of the cast , especially frank keenan as the father , are either stiff or overly emotive in their roles , which makes ray that much more appealing in contrast . <sssss> characteristic of the times , white actors in black face play the two household slaves . <sssss> while the condition of the print makes evaluation of the cinematography difficult , the interior scenes for the most part betray the flimsy sets that were used . <sssss> however , the exterior shots , especially the brief battle scenes , are convincing and effective . <sssss> `` the coward '' is an amiable film with a well-worn plot and is likely typical of silent films that were produced prior to the 1920 's . <sssss> while neither a work of art nor even the best of its era , the film offers an interesting glimpse of what entertained moviegoers during the years before world war i. 
ur2467618/		\tt0005149		6		i think a lot of the impact of this early silence feature film is lost today , but more about that later in the review . <sssss> when it was released in 1915 , attitudes about plot and drama were very different than today . <sssss> predictability was expected from movies and what we would consider over-acting was the norm . <sssss> also , having white folks run around in black face playing slaves was , unfortunately , pretty widely accepted . <sssss> and so , by 1915 standards , this is an exceptional movie and one of the earliest full-length films ever made . <sssss> i think it is a lot better than its contemporary , birth of a nation -- which is ponderously long and one of the most racist films made in america . <sssss> unfortunately for the makers of this film , people in 1915 preferred birth of a nation and it went on to make a ton of money and was hailed as one of the greatest films ever made . <sssss> that 's really a shame , because there are some exceptional aspects to this film that have been overlooked . <sssss> in particular , the costumes and battle sequences are excellent -lrb- though not quite as grand as those in birth of a nation -rrb- and the story , though very simplistic and predictable , is still compelling . <sssss> and , its use of two white folks in black makeup , though appalling , is not nearly as offensive as about 90 % of the other film . <sssss> now , as for today 's audiences , the plot is very very dusty to say the least . <sssss> having the son be afraid of war and deserting was excellent , but the contrived way that his own father accidentally shoots and kills him in battle is so over-the-top dramatically -lrb- though not in its day -rrb- . <sssss> but , it is still worth seeing for its historical value . <sssss> not a great or memorable film , but one of the most watchable of the early feature-length films .

ur1298724/		\tt0006296		6		wished on mabel is a pleasant ensemble piece set entirely in a park . <sssss> it features two of keystone 's most popular stars , mabel normand and roscoe arbuckle , though neither one dominates the proceedings . <sssss> they play a pair of happy young lovers , enjoying a day outside with mabel 's mother . <sssss> early on they 're harassed by a persistent bumblebee -lrb- which results in a memorably funny close-up of mabel looking cross-eyed as the bee lights on her nose -rrb- , but otherwise everything is peachy , at least at first . <sssss> complications set in when a watch is stolen from mabel 's mother ; confusion escalates and the watch changes hands several times before the matter is resolved . <sssss> the ensemble work in this film is a treat for silent comedy buffs : the thief who swipes the watch is played by joe bordeaux , a supporting player who appeared in many of arbuckle 's comedies but seldom so prominently featured as he is here . <sssss> bordeaux is pursued by perennial cop edgar kennedy , best remembered as a latter-day foil for laurel & hardy , still quite young and athletic in 1915 and not so bald as he would become . <sssss> it 's kennedy the cop who sets this little saga in motion , indirectly anyhow , by rousting the sleeping bordeaux from a park bench -lrb- so that he can stretch out himself , naturally -rrb- , prompting the crime spree . <sssss> along the way we get a quick look at glen cavender , who would go on to play the chief union spy in buster keaton 's the general , among many other roles . <sssss> viewers unfamiliar with keystone comedies may be surprised at how quickly the characters resort to violence : kennedy the cop swings his billy club with abandon , not only at bordeaux but at an innocent bystander , while mabel rebuffs bordeaux 's mild advances with several swift punches . <sssss> still , this comedy is less violent than others the stars made at the time , and the tone is generally light-hearted . <sssss> both roscoe and mabel did more memorable work elsewhere , but it 's a pleasure to see them looking so sprightly and happy as they do here . <sssss> wished on mabel is a pleasant romp , not hilarious but less frantic than some of the other keystones , and certainly worthwhile for silent comedy fans .

ur0562732/		\tt0006333		4		when i read during the opening credits of the 1916 adaptation of jules verne 's `` 20,000 leagues under the sea , '' immediately i assumed the frame of mind that i always do when watching early films , so as not to criticize it 's lack of special effects or advanced film techniques . <sssss> immediately i was immensely impressed at the transfer from book to film , as the film followed the story closely and faithfully . <sssss> unfortunately , this only lasted for about the first ten minutes of the film , which ultimately proved to take verne 's work and butcher it in every way imaginable . <sssss> probably the most jarring change to the story is that they decided to not only adapt leagues , but also another verne novel , mysterious island , into this film . <sssss> so the result is that you have two totally different stories taking place that do n't at all seem to fit together , until finally they come together in the bizarre conclusion , which makes absolutely no sense in respect to the novel . <sssss> my current theory is that because so much of the original novel of 20,000 leagues was decades beyond the reach of the filmmakers to be able to put on screen , so they probably had to look to an entirely separate novel just to have enough material to fill a full length film . <sssss> sadly , it reminds me of those terrible songs that radio stations sometimes come up with when they combine two popular songs together that have a similar beat , resulting in something that is not quite equal to but definitely less than the originals . <sssss> one such bizarre hybrid comes to mind involving closer , by nine inch nails , and garbage 's # 1 crush . <sssss> the basic , basic , basic plot structure remains , but literally 95 % of the story is gone . <sssss> there is rumor of a massive sea monster and the crew of the abraham lincoln set off to capture it . <sssss> strangely enough , at one point it passes a mere few meters from their ship in broad daylight , and the crew can clearly see the steel plated sides and the rivets holding it together , even the bridge and periscope , and yet they still think it 's a sea monster . <sssss> i 'll attribute that to the inability to emulate the nautilus 's movements as described in the novel , but in this way we also have to sacrifice the entirety of the ship 's glorious design and function , which is not even described in dialogue . <sssss> for the most part , we see a single room , which looks like an old victorian bedroom with one wall that looks like it belongs in a boiler room . <sssss> probably the worst crime that the film commits is in the character of captain nemo . <sssss> granted , nemo in the novel is not exactly the most charming and charismatic man , but it is as if they set out in this film to create a man as far from the original description as humanly possible . <sssss> as a result , we get a bizarre spectacle that looks like a disgruntled santa clause in blackface . <sssss> and not only that , throughout the film he gives several displays of compassion that the original nemo would have scoffed at . <sssss> indeed , at one point , he torpedoes a ship , and then afterwards and then almost faints as he worries about the safety of the victims . <sssss> what the hell ?? <sssss> and incidentally , verne 's nautilus did n't have torpedoes , although he did use it as a ramming weapon . <sssss> in the film 's defense , the underwater photography is truly impressive given the time that it was filmed , and surely knocked 1916 audiences , most of whom had probably never seen the underwater world , out of their seats . <sssss> this would certainly explain the seemingly endless lingering on these scenes . <sssss> their is also an interesting allusion to another verne novel , as at one point in their underwater tour they come across a decayed shipwreck , which nemo describes as `` the wreck of an old blockade runner . '' <sssss> and the worst thing about the bizarre personification of nemo in this film is the backstory that was invented for the film which , amazingly , is introduced with this intertitle - `` captain nemo reveals the tragic secret of his life , which jules verne never told . '' <sssss> what follows is the most bizarre story imaginable , which claims that nemo was previously some kind of empirical royalty who lived in an empire `` beyond the sea . '' <sssss> one man wrongs him , which does n't explain his subsequent disdain , and even hatred , for all of mankind of all nations , nor does anything explain why he took to the sea . <sssss> and incidentally , nemo is a man of art , science , biology , history , astronomy , etc. . <sssss> the transition from his old life to the one we see is totally senseless . <sssss> it may very well be that this was one of the first major films to set the trend of adapting novels to film , and while modern adaptations still make ridiculous changes to story and characters where they do n't belong , at least those inexplicable liberties seem to have diminished since 1916 ! 
ur0094922/		\tt0006333		5		this may have been thrilling in 1916 , but today it seems more of a curio . <sssss> the williamson brothers invented a camera to take pictures underwater , -lrb- the prologue tells us , complete with photos of them -rrb- so there 's lots of shots of fish swimming , the bottom of the sea , men in diving suits and one battle with an octopus , which was a bit fuzzy . <sssss> still , the sense of watching movie history was strong , but do n't expect too much in light of more modern techniques . <sssss> what really bothered me was the hammy acting styles , with lots of arm motions and exaggerated facial features . <sssss> it 's the style that gave silent films a bad name . <sssss> one who avoided this was matt moore , the hero of the film , and the only actor i recognized . <sssss> perhaps that is why he was still making movies in the 50 's . <sssss> the film uses plot elements of verne 's `` the mysterious island '' as well as `` twenty thousand leagues under the sea .

ur1298724/		\tt0006688		7		douglas fairbanks is remembered primarily as a swashbuckling hero , the original robin hood , zorro , and thief of bagdad , but in his earlier years on screen he appeared in a series of breezy action comedies , thereby creating the template that would be followed by a number of latter-day comedians , notably harold lloyd . <sssss> the young doug of these films has the same bright-eyed and ambitious `` go-getter '' persona found in the lloyd comedies of the '20s , and the stories usually culminate in a chase of some sort . <sssss> on occasion , as in wild and woolly and the mollycoddle , doug starts off as a foolish or downright effete character who must take some hard knocks in order to grow up and win the respect of his peers , his girl , and his audience , the basic formula that lloyd and buster keaton would employ , too . <sssss> flirting with fate is a good example of this sort of comedy , and while it 's not doug 's best work it makes for an entertaining hour 's worth of viewing . <sssss> here he plays an artist with financial problems , in love with a girl from a much higher social set . <sssss> one minor drawback is that the early scenes of plot exposition are too leisurely and short on laughs ; the supporting actors play it straight , and we wait in vain for the jolly title cards , sight gags , and satirical touches that abound in the later fairbanks comedies . <sssss> it takes a while for the comic situation to kick in , and meanwhile a series of depressing setbacks are suffered by our hero , eventually causing him to make a half-hearted attempt at suicide . <sssss> we never really believe that doug is going to go through with it , but the dark tone in these opening scenes may come as an unwelcome surprise for viewers unfamiliar with the premise . <sssss> doug 's inability to kill himself brings about the plot twist that launches the comedy in earnest , and it 's a twist that may have been familiar even in 1916 : doug -lrb- who is uncharacteristically wimpy in this movie -rrb- ca n't face killing himself , so he hires a hit man . <sssss> then , of course , his luck changes for the better , and he wants very much to live , only now he must avoid assassination from the killer he hired , who may be disguised . <sssss> doug himself dons the world 's most unconvincing fake beard and goes to great lengths to elude his assassin . <sssss> this is where the movie really takes off , and the second half is quite funny . <sssss> the actor who plays the intended hit man , george , is terrific , so good he practically steals the show from the nominal star . <sssss> there are several sequences where doug fearfully imagines scenarios in which he might get killed , and these deliberately overplayed , melodramatic vignettes -- strikingly performed before black backdrops -- are the highlight of the film , thanks largely to 's burlesque villainy . <sssss> douglas fairbanks would go on to produce far more sophisticated movies than flirting with fate , but those interested in his early work will find this one quite enjoyable , once it gets rolling .

'' <sssss> -lrb- i seem to recall that louis feuillade 's serial ` judex -lrb- 1916 -rrb- ' also featured a similar gadget -rrb- . <sssss> ` the mystery of the leaping fish ' is an odd little spoof . <sssss> it was released two years after cocaine was effectively outlawed in the united states by the harrison narcotics tax act of 1914 . <sssss> our hero 's mission , though this becomes a little unclear in the convoluted , is to bust an operation . <sssss> he does this , but not before he 's tasted enough of the stuff to satisfy his appetite . <sssss> drug addiction is lightly passed over as an amusing quirk . <sssss> whenever he feels down , coke ennyday injects himself with cocaine , and immediately perks up , proceeding to laugh and dance across the room -lrb- indeed , he essentially bounces through the entire final act -rrb- . <sssss> drugs are even depicted as a useful weapon of sorts : when faced with one formidable foe , ennyday simply injects his opponent , who promptly jumps to the ceiling . <sssss> in scenes like this , reversed footage is used to amusing effect , as in g.w. bitzer 's ` the impossible convicts -lrb- 1906 -rrb- .

ur1888886/		\tt0008827		6		`` amarilly of clothes-line alley '' is a somewhat interesting film technically and is rather representative of its times . <sssss> francis marion and mary pickford departed from pickford 's persona as a child character for this one , which i consider a good thing . <sssss> and , marion 's scenario involving two characters from opposing social classes , two story-lines that begin separately but are destined to collide , is something that was becoming more common in cinema as a means of making social commentary . <sssss> the rapid crosscutting , in addition to the extensive scene dissection -lrb- changes of camera placement within a scene -rrb- , was also cutting edge . <sssss> the print quality is n't the best now , the look of the images -lrb- the tinting and such -rrb- probably alters too frequently , and the editing and construction seems rather unpolished at times , but the film does remain fresh today compared to the slower films from around this time and before . <sssss> this film is n't especially innovative in any of this , as d.w. griffith probably deserves the most credit , but it is representative of the way hollywood films were going . <sssss> future films would be less hasty in their montage , creating images that are more lasting . <sssss> the social commentary is n't particularly enlightening : the rich ones come off badly , and the film mostly explores contrasts . <sssss> much in the intertitles is vernacular , too . <sssss> nevertheless , `` amarilly of clothes-line alley '' is entertaining enough , although the film 's conclusion is odd , including marion drawing attention to herself as the film 's author . <sssss> that was more up fellow screenwriter anita loos 's alley ; she unraveled douglas fairbanks 's -lrb- soon to be pickford 's husband -rrb- comedies in clever , self-referential ways . <sssss> anyhow , pickford is fun to watch as a lower-class in her lighter vehicles , and kate price is especially amusing in the supporting role of her mother in this one .

ur3109237/		\tt0010323		7		the cabinet of dr. caligari is , for me , a tale of two movies . <sssss> on one hand , there 's no denying the film 's historical significance or amazing `` look '' . <sssss> instead of going into detail on the film 's historical significance , i think that simply stating the fact that the cabinet of dr. caligari is a german horror film from 1920 pretty much sums it up . <sssss> as for the `` look '' of the film , the cabinet of dr. caligari is a beautiful nightmare . <sssss> the twisted images are something to behold . <sssss> it 's like a work of art come to life . <sssss> the sight of conrad veidt dressed in black , looking like a shadow that has taken on human characteristics , slinking down a hall on the way to his next victim is an image that stays with you . <sssss> the set design is brilliant . <sssss> the skewed shapes of ordinary objects like windows and doors and the use of paint to represent light and shadows is stunning . <sssss> filmmakers today could spend literally millions trying to create the `` look '' found in the cabinet of dr. caligari and never achieve anything nearly as memorable . <sssss> but , as i said , the cabinet of dr. caligari is the tale of two movies . <sssss> once you get past the film 's place in history and the stylized look , you 're left with the plot . <sssss> and this is where i have problems with the movie . <sssss> as i 've said any number of times , i ultimately watch movies for entertainment . <sssss> it may seem shallow to some , but if i 'm not entertained , i ca n't in good conscious rate a film highly just because of technical or some other achievement . <sssss> as a vehicle for entertainment , the cabinet of dr. caligari let me down . <sssss> i was never drawn into or felt engaged by the story . <sssss> the plot is so overly simplistic that i found much of the goings on dull . <sssss> do n't misunderstand . <sssss> my problems with the film have nothing to do with it being a silent movie . <sssss> it may sound cliché , but some of my favorite movies -lrb- the unknown being at the top of the list -rrb- are silent . <sssss> it 's unfortunate that the plot of the cabinet of dr. caligari is in no way as memorable as the `` look '' of the film . 
ur1234929/		\tt0010323		7		dr. caligari and his sleepwalking fortune teller cesare -lrb- conrad veidt -rrb- come to the local fair . <sssss> this event coincides with a series of brutal murders . <sssss> what , if anything , is the connection ? <sssss> widely -lrb- and falsely -rrb- considered to be the first true horror film ever made , we have to give it credit for all that it inspired . <sssss> from films of its day all the way to tim burton 's `` nightmare before christmas '' , the german expressionist art movement put to film creates a strong impression in the stark black and white . <sssss> the sets are what really make this film . <sssss> rather than being shot outside -lrb- apparently due to lack of budget -rrb- , everything was done in the studio , and the sets were painted . <sssss> even the shadows are painted and not actual shadows . <sssss> what will strike the audience is how much the use of uneven angles was used -- windows , doors , walls and more are all slanted . <sssss> if nothing else , this really aids in making the film memorable . <sssss> while i can not rate it as highly as most do -lrb- i found it to drag a bit at times and could have used about five minutes of edits despite only being 71 minutes long -rrb- , it really is a must see for anyone interested in the history of horror or film . <sssss> or german expressionism , i suppose . <sssss> the writers were influenced by the films of paul wegener -lrb- `` student of prague '' and `` the golem '' -rrb- , which led them to not only make a horror film , but an expressionist film . <sssss> what level of the art is the writers ' doing and which part the director , i can not say . <sssss> -lrb- on a side note , the producers wanted fritz lang to direct ... it is anyone 's guess how this would have affected the picture . <sssss> lang , of course , is a bigger name in early film than robert wiene , who made his directing debut here . <sssss> -rrb- allegedly , the beginning and end had to be added because of some sort of political influence and concerns about defying authority . <sssss> historian siegfried said of this , `` a revolutionary film was thus turned into a conformist one . '' <sssss> the stories i read differ on this and i do n't know what to believe . <sssss> the important thing to keep in mind , though , is how greatly the film varies with or without the bookends . <sssss> the film is silent and not all copies are of the highest quality , so be aware of that going in . <sssss> if you know this , it is definitely worth checking out . <sssss> this is one of the first classics , and truly a necessary film for anyone who thinks of themselves as a horror fan .

'' <sssss> the end . <sssss> nowadays as the camera fades towards black the good shrink would of course do something bizarre to let us know he really is the evil caligari . <sssss> . <sssss> but back in the day . <sssss> . <sssss> 1921 afterall . <sssss> . <sssss> that 's not how you ended films . <sssss> i think if i edited the film i would simply leave off the final intertitle giving the shrink 's little upbeat speech to leave a tiny bit of doubt in the viewer 's mind . <sssss> oh , but that 's just me . <sssss> i rated this classic what is a classic a full 10 marks . <sssss> mostly because i like how the old expressionist film works so well with rainer 's music . <sssss> the music and the intertitles have a gorgeous flavor that i really like . <sssss> engagingly retro . 
ur17470614/		\tt0010323		8		here 's another classic from the silent era . <sssss> this german expressionist film also commonly goes by the title of , das cabinet des dr. caligari . <sssss> it is considered highly influential due to its artistic direction and i 'll discuss that in a moment . <sssss> the story takes place in the german mountain village of . <sssss> the tale is told in a series of flashbacks by the main character , francis , who along with his friend alan , visit an attraction at a carnival . <sssss> there , they witness dr. caligari , who presents to the audience his somnambulist attraction , cesare -- a man with a severe sleeping disorder who has the ability of predicting `` future '' events . <sssss> cesare informs alan that he will die tomorrow , a prediction that later proves to be true . <sssss> eventually , francis and his girlfriend jane , try investigating caligari and cesare until the story produces an interesting twist . <sssss> german expressionism was an artistic movement that covered various mediums during the 1920 's . <sssss> in terms of cinema , european production crews had a difficult time emulating the more realistic and high-budget approach to film-making that was introduced by universal in the united states . <sssss> the reaction to this was a more `` artistic '' angle , one that touched upon a deeper meaning with the use of symbolism -- usually of a darker nature . <sssss> various intellectual topics were explored and would serve as a basis and inspiration for countless films in the generations to come . <sssss> i like to classify the cabinet of dr. caligari as an early approach to . <sssss> the sets are constructed in a very angular and abstract fashion -- slanted rooftops and doorways . <sssss> there are several instances of deep shadows in contrast with lighter tones . <sssss> at first glance , it may seen absurd to compare the various visual styles in black and white film stock -- but they do exist . <sssss> if you 're familiar with film noir , it was a product of this early movement . <sssss> despite my praises of historical importance , i found the pacing of this film a bit slow . <sssss> i still prefer nosferatu , but the artistic direction is entirely different -- `` cabinet '' it 's worth seeing for that alone .

ur20851867/		\tt0010323		1		i arranged the reviews for this movie by rating , and got an interesting surprise : the lowest rating given by a reviewer to it at the time of writing was `` 4 '' stars . <sssss> i hope after i give it its first `` 1 '' star review that cesare wo n't come and cut my balls off !! <sssss> this film is considered by most to be a `` classic '' , a `` masterpiece '' and a great example of the art of `` expressionism '' . <sssss> i agree !! <sssss> but only if the english languages changes and they create a new dictionary in which `` classic '' means `` primitive '' , `` masterpiece '' means `` failed '' and `` expressionism '' is synonymous with `` hilarious '' . <sssss> i sat through what seemed like 9 hours of stupidity , over-the-top acting and mind numbingly exaggerated facial expressions , holding myself from firing judgements before i see and comprehend the full work . <sssss> this was a truly hard task , especially that i had to watch it on three parts on three different days because every time i ran the kino dvd and watch for a while , i lost any desire to stay awake and fell asleep . <sssss> i swear this did happen to me , not a figure of speech . <sssss> and boy o boy was i rewarded at the end ? <sssss> that would be a `` yes '' , if you consider a spit right into your eyeball by someone who has just eaten a a `` reward '' . <sssss> let me get to the point cause this thing does not deserve more time than i have already wasted on it . <sssss> by the end of the film , i was left with no possible logical explanation for what might have took place . <sssss> but reading the fans ' comments , i found them to be under the impression that either of two scenarios could make a satisfactory explanation : 1 -rrb- the is in fact caligari himself who is a murderer -lrb- or the mastermind behind cesare 's killings -rrb- , and francis is wrongfully incarcerated by the director to keep him from telling the truth . <sssss> this is impossible and quite a dumb explanation indeed , because in that case there would still be other reliable people who have seen the respected director doing the sleep-walking show in the fair . <sssss> this is in addition to the policemen who went into his tent and found the dummy placed in cesare 's box while the real cesare was out killing . <sssss> did director put those witnesses and the police in the mad house too ? <sssss> silly , ai n't it ? <sssss> 2 -rrb- the other explanation fans suggest is that francis is insane , he did -lrb- or did n't , same thing -rrb- commit the crimes himself , and he has imagined the whole thing about the innocent director being caligari the homicidal maniac . <sssss> to support this explanation , they refer to how the settings and decor looked real only in the beginning -lrb- when francis starts telling the story -rrb- and at the end -lrb- after he finishes it -rrb- , while in between settings looked surreal and . <sssss> this explanation is impossible too . <sssss> if francis was making it all up , then his story would have ended with something that happened to him that lead to the present situation -lrb- him in the mad house and the director free as a bird -rrb- . <sssss> for example his story would have ended with something like `` and of course they took the director 's word over mine and falsely accused me of being insane and here i am in the crazy house and no one listens to me '' . <sssss> but how exactly would his story end with them finding out the truth and locking the director in the cell ? <sssss> what the hell is francis doing in the mad house then ? <sssss> as for the settings being surreal in his story but realistic outside of it , this is simply a mass hallucination of some kind among viewers !! <sssss> right after they discovered the dummy and francis went running after caligari into the mad house , and while we were still watching the story from the madman 's point of view , we see the mad house as real as it gets using exactly the same setting as used after francis finishes his story and we are back to `` real '' world . <sssss> and when francis is restrained and locked into a cell at the end of the film , we are back to surreal !! <sssss> people are giving it high ratings for its historical and sentimental values , but a fair and subjective look would find it to be nothing more than a very tedious and boring work that does not make any sense . <sssss> some movies could still entertain you even after you put logic and meaningfulness to sleep , but this film fails on this level too , and for the life of me i could find absolutely no trace of the anti-authoritarianism theme allegedly hidden in it . <sssss> authoritarianism in germany one year following its defeat in ww1 ? <sssss> wow !! <sssss> i 've seen die-hard movie fans go too far before , but never as far as to write a new history that fits their wishful thinking just to claim the superiority of a movie !!

ur13283282/		\tt0011000		7		carl theodor dreyer 's second feature film is an ambitious study of evil through the ages , but the great danish filmmaker is years away from his masterpieces of the passion of joan of arc , vampyr , day of wrath , ordet and gertrud . <sssss> the inexperienced filmmaker was influenced by d.w. griffith 's 1916 intolerance and aimed to map out the path of the devil using griffith 's innovative filming style as a guide . <sssss> he added on his realistic approach to the subject matter , as he believed realism to be the most essential part of any film . <sssss> like its inspiration , intolerance , leaves from satan 's book contains stories from four historical periods linked thematically . <sssss> unlike griffith 's film though , dreyer chose not to cross cut between stories , which makes for a less confusing film . <sssss> satan is the character who links the four stories . <sssss> the film starts with his fall from grace , as told through inter-titles , and god 's proclamation that he walk the earth tempting humanity . <sssss> for each soul that turns from god , 100 years will be added to satan 's sentence , but for every person who resists his temptations , 1000 years will be removed . <sssss> hoping to fail in his duties so that he may be admitted back into heaven , satan tries to get men to betray what they hold most dear in four eras of history . <sssss> the first section of the film is the biblical story of jesus ' betrayal by judas . <sssss> the next story takes place during the spanish inquisition . <sssss> the third section of the film takes place during the french revolution . <sssss> the final segment is set in the finland during the war of 1918 . <sssss> as a film , this was n't dreyer 's best , but it was fairly entertaining . <sssss> this early dreyer film shows his almost innate ability to compose attractive images within the limits of the frame . <sssss> though this film is n't the grand spectacle he was hoping for , dreyer did a wonderful job with it . <sssss> his use of the film frame and style of story telling make this a movie interesting and attractive to watch .

ur5380096/		\tt0011607		8		-lrb- literal translation of title : the parson 's widow -rrb- . <sssss> the parson 's widow is significant for two reasons -- it is one of the very few national romantic films , and it 's one of the very first films to make extensive use of locations . <sssss> national romanticism was a 19th century movement that glorified pure hearted , independent farmers -lrb- as opposed to the aristocrats -rrb- and looked to the hinterlands as a source of pure culture and moral inspiration . <sssss> it was particularly influential in norway , the film 's location . <sssss> as the parson 's widow begins , , a divinity student , is offered a position in a rural parish ¬ -- provided he marries the parson 's elderly widow . <sssss> he accepts , despite his betrothal to mari , whom he passes off as his sister . <sssss> this theme could exist only in a land where poverty and hunger were facts of life . <sssss> modern audiences may find the parson 's widow overly moralistic and sentimental . <sssss> it has a 19th century feel -- owing more to romantics like than to more modern novelists like knut hamsun , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1920 , the year the film was made . <sssss> at that point , national romanticism was on its way out . <sssss> the story has a few supernatural overtones , but this is no horror film . <sssss> in the parson 's widow , the fantastic elements originate from folk beliefs and function primarily as cultural references . <sssss> set in an indefinite past , the parson 's widow makes extensive use of locations at a time when few filmmakers ventured beyond studio doors . <sssss> it idealizes rural life in a way that anticipates robert flaherty 's man of aran . <sssss> and , like flaherty 's film , the parson 's widow meticulously recreates practices that were rapidly disappearing . <sssss> the opening scenes were shot at -lrb- stave church -rrb- in -- the open air museum in lillehammer , norway . <sssss> the farmstead scenes are probably shot at the same place , and the older extras would have been the last generation to learn the crafts they demonstrate as part of daily life . <sssss> people today will view the parson 's widow primarily because it is an early film of director carl theodore dreyer . <sssss> but this is no beginner 's work . <sssss> beautiful composition , expressive lighting , and obsessive attention to detail are signature marks of the director who gave us the passion of joan of arc and vampyr . <sssss> the parson 's widow stands as a minor masterpiece in its own right , but the romanticism is unlikely to resonate with today 's audiences . 
ur0453068/		\tt0011607		8		the parson 's widow is not entirely a really great silent film ; it loses some of its strengths as a satire on marriage and -lrb- partially -rrb- religion when it starts to get a little sentimental towards the end . <sssss> but for a while , one sees a film by the master danish filmmaker carl th . <sssss> dreyer flexing his directorial muscles on something that is something one might not expect from seeing such pieces of perfect tragedy like joan of arc or day of wrath . <sssss> here we get the story of sofren -lrb- einar rod -rrb- , an unconventional would-be parson who ` auditions ' for the position by going on about the devil in an off-beat manner -lrb- yes , off-beat -rrb- . <sssss> he learns that in order to become the village parson , he needs to marry the presumed local old witch , miss -lrb- grim-faced -rrb- , who lures him in with a piece of cursed cod and has him succumb to marry her - but he really wants mari -lrb- -rrb- , and can not until she dies . <sssss> but when ? <sssss> there 's some splendid comic set-pieces set in here , like with sofren trying to scare the old miss in a sheet , only to be foiled by his own slippers , or when sofren tries to sneak out at night to see mari and continually gets caught -lrb- or , in one case , another old woman in the bed ! <sssss> -rrb- but what 's more amazing here is dreyer 's choices in casting . <sssss> rod is perfect for this kind of frustrated , ambitious but conniving sort , with great and imaginative eyes that do a lot while seeming to do little -lrb- one compared this as dreyer doing day of wrath as a chaplin , but i do n't see much of chaplin in his main male lead -rrb- , and is so dead-on for this old widow who may or may die -lrb- depending on if a potion works -rrb- that it 's among some of dreyer 's best actors in one of his movies . <sssss> while dreyer sometimes loses his footing in the story , as mentioned towards the end , he makes up for it with some curious scenes , like the dance at the wedding , or the specific use of colored tints . <sssss> when has the weird dream state of seeing a ` young ' miss , we see it in a haze of light red -lrb- or maybe blue -rrb- , and it 's completely dazzling for a moment . <sssss> it might be a slightly lighter affair than his more ` serious ' pictures , but for the curious digging into dreyer 's catalog , it 's not at all a disappointment . <sssss> at its best parson 's widow has a good , hard farcical grip on the subject matter . 
ur2481329/		\tt0011607		6		over the mountain wander sofren and mari . <sssss> sofren is a student of theology come to apply for the vacant position of parson in this rural norwegian village . <sssss> mari is his fiancée , but not yet his wife because her father wo n't allow it until he becomes a real parson . <sssss> luckily for him , his two competitors from copenhagen are n't particularly up to the task . <sssss> the first looks like a cross between john lennon and bill gates and bores his audience to sleep , so much so that even the man tasked with keeping everyone awake drops off ; and the other is a bloated fool who keeps them amused only because sofren has stuck a feather to the back of his head . <sssss> so sofren it is : the five bearded elders tasked with the decision do n't have much of a task after all , given that he 's young and dynamic and can think on his feet . <sssss> however , there 's a catch , for there must always be a catch . <sssss> the local custom is that the parson 's widow comes with the job . <sssss> this was n't for any religious reason , merely a practical one because someone has to take care of her , after all , but this particular parson 's widow , dame margarete , has outlasted the previous three parsons only to be handed over each time to their successors ` like a piece of furniture ' . <sssss> and just as sofren had no problem outsmarting his rivals , who run for the hills the moment they see dame margarete anyway , the parson 's widow outsmarts sofren . <sssss> eager to retain her position running the parson 's house , she persuades him subtly to propose . <sssss> there 's mention that she may be a witch but she really accomplishes it with a herring and a bottle of schnapps . <sssss> so sofren becomes the parson and dame margarete becomes the parson 's wife once more , mistress of her whole domain . <sssss> and with this setup , with mari introduced into the mix as sofren 's sister rather than his fiancée , naturally hilarity ensues . <sssss> well hilarity is a strong term , given that this is a swedish silent film from 1920 and a carl theodor dreyer movie to boot , but it 's a lot closer to hilarity than i 'd have ever imagined for one of his films . <sssss> i 've seen a lot of them , having been utterly stunned by the passion of joan of arc and fascinated into finding as much of the rest of his work that i could . <sssss> this was the second film dreyer directed , but the eighth of his fourteen feature length movies for me . <sssss> it 's the first to invoke laughter , which comes about mostly in a subtle way but with some stooping to pantomime , such as the scenes where sofren prances around in an elaborate satan suit after he becomes convinced that his wife is a witch . <sssss> it 's constructed well , with strong performances and memorable characters , varied shots and varied expectations . <sssss> it looks good , whether inside or out , and there 's a lot of use of the common silent film masking technique that turns the screen into a small circle to highlight what we should be looking at . <sssss> as would fit a story built around a folk custom , there 's a great deal here that speaks to customs and folklore , from dances to rituals to beliefs . <sssss> quite which scandinavian culture or cultures this applies to , i 'm not sure , given that it 's a swedish film set in norway but based on a danish story , but they 're fascinating . <sssss> and backing up dreyer 's direction , dreyer being a man who controlled his films as surely as dame margarete controls her household , are a number of memorable performances . <sssss> einar plays sofren as something of an imp . <sssss> we rarely see him in church , this being one of the least religious religious films i 've ever seen . <sssss> instead we watch him try all sorts of hare brained schemes to try to see his mari , always coming up short but learning something in the process , there very much being a lesson here in and amidst the comedy . <sssss> greta is a wholesome but frustrated mari , reminding a little of elsa lanchester . <sssss> best of all is as dame margarete , dominant throughout but always human . <sssss> born as far back as 1843 , she was 76 when she made this film , her third and last . <sssss> with a memorable face with many lines showing her age and a memorable gait that would have made her a prime candidate for a major role in a zombie movie , it 's sad that she would n't make any more . <sssss> she died two months before this film was released . <sssss> i wonder if they nailed a horseshoe above her door and sprinkled oil on the ground to ensure she did n't come back to haunt her house .

ur13591406/		\tt0011652		4		this film is not up to buster keaton 's standards . <sssss> the most interesting part of the film is the introduction , in which you see shadows of the stars in picture frames and then the shadows come to life and you see some of the stars of the movie . <sssss> it 's been said that this movie is a re-make of the lamb -lrb- 1915 -rrb- , but it is n't . <sssss> the lamb , which was douglas fairbanks ' film debut , was much better . <sssss> fairbanks ' character was n't a wimp , like keaton 's character is in the saphead . <sssss> the only reason i do n't give it a lower score is because of keaton 's presence in the movie , even though there is not much to like about his character . <sssss> he 's a wimp . <sssss> so if you 're looking for an example of his work , just about any of his other silent features or shorts that he stars in would be better than this . 
ur16932486/		\tt0011779		10		this has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns i have ever seen . <sssss> having a soft spot for the genre -lrb- westerns are -- or were , since they are no longer made very often -- morality plays that too often have been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions -rrb- , i purchased the dvd , sight unseen , because i had read enough about william s. hart 's work -lrb- much of which he wrote and directed -rrb- to pique my interest and thought i should have at least one of his films in my video collection . <sssss> i must admit that i approached the actual viewing with some trepidation . <sssss> my previous experiences with silent cinema `` classics '' had left me feeling let down . <sssss> chaney 's the phantom of the opera , griffith 's birth of a nation and fairbanks ' the mark of zorro were fine , but not nearly as good as their reputations would lead one to expect . <sssss> they were either too long , or too theatrical , or both . <sssss> the toll gate , however , emerged as a pleasant surprise . <sssss> it is a story told in a simple and straightforward manner . <sssss> black deering -lrb- played by hart -rrb- , leader of a notoriously successful outlaw gang , thinks the time has come for group to disband , before its luck runs out . <sssss> he is , however , opposed by his chief lieutenant , jordan , who goads them all into one last holdup by promising great wealth but leads them into a trap in which he is complicit . <sssss> everyone is killed except deering , who is taken prisoner . <sssss> when his captors recognize him as the man who once saved a number of soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an impending indian attack , they allow him to escape . <sssss> free , he tries to find honest work but is snubbed and ridiculed and ultimately must rob again to survive . <sssss> soon , he is pursued not only by the sheriff 's posse but also by jordan -lrb- now prospering from the reward money he has collected -rrb- and his henchmen . <sssss> his flight leads him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mother and her little son . <sssss> after some initial misgivings , they take him into their hearts . <sssss> deering sees a chance for a new life but , with the posse and jordan closing in , realizes that this may not be possible . <sssss> hart was the first great western star and the first to inject realism into the genre . <sssss> as one of the pioneers of movie-making , he created many of the characters and situations that have become cliché in westerns for more than ninety years . <sssss> what keeps his movies interesting , however , was his ability to go beyond the cliché -lrb- perhaps his imitators did not go far enough -rrb- so that the material appears fresh and innovative , even now . <sssss> three such instances in the toll gate illustrate this : 1 -rrb- in one scene , his character shoots into a crowd in an attempt to kill jordan , and kills a bystander instead . <sssss> a subsequent close-up shows that he is clearly frustrated . <sssss> the frustration , however , comes not from the fact that he has gunned down a man who had hitherto caused him no harm but that he missed his intended target . <sssss> 2 -rrb- in another , as he flees from the posse , his `` borrowed '' horse steps into a gopher hole and breaks a leg . <sssss> hart pulls out his gun to put the animal out of its misery but , before pulling the trigger , gives his head a sad , loving pat , as if to say farewell to an old friend . <sssss> 3 -rrb- and finally , after he has strangled jordan and thrown his body over a cliff , he returns to retrieve his guns and spots his adversary 's pistol lying on the ground nearby . <sssss> he steps forward and gives it a swift kick before mounting his horse . <sssss> it is a simple gesture but it underscores the deep loathing he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades . <sssss> and i love the title , the toll gate . <sssss> it is allegorical in its implication that a man can not begin a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old one . <sssss> deering 's payment comes in the form of sacrifice . <sssss> today 's more sophisticated audiences may not buy into that sentiment entirely but it can still work on you if you let it . <sssss> viewers who like their videos in pristine condition will undoubtedly object to the dvd 's picture quality , especially the badly deteriorated final reel . <sssss> i do n't mind at all . <sssss> that a copy of this 1920 movie even exists at all is a miracle since prints of so many other silent movies have been lost . <sssss> if you bear that in mind and look upon the film as a piece of history , its visual flaws are not that difficult to

ur0542650/		\tt0011841		8		one of d.w. griffith 's last big commercial successes , ` way down east ' represents much that was good in griffith 's directorial style and much that was wanting in it . <sssss> overall , it is a very solid movie and leaves the viewer satisfied in the end . <sssss> it is certainly not the ideal film to show someone who has never watched a silent feature film , however . <sssss> anyone who has studied film history knows about the famous ice flow scene in which lillian gish put herself at tremendous risk in real-life blizzard conditions . <sssss> this is the climax , but it comes only after a long and occasionally dragging journey . <sssss> the lovely ms. gish plays anna moore , a naïve small town girl , tricked into a fake marriage by notorious womanizing playboy lennox sanderson -lrb- lowell sherman -rrb- . <sssss> finding out about the sham only after telling sanderson she is pregnant , she is abandoned and later evicted after both her mother and the baby die . <sssss> her past later catches up with her after she has established herself as a beloved maid in the bartlett household , where son david -lrb- matinee idol richard -rrb- is in love with her . <sssss> it is when her past is revealed and squire bartlett -lrb- burr mcintosh -rrb- throws her out into a blizzard that the famed ice flow sequence takes place . <sssss> there are some faults in ` way down east . ' <sssss> it is long -- probably a bit longer than it needs to be . <sssss> plenty of time is spent in establishing the various characters , both major and minor , and the locales . <sssss> there are a few spots where things seem to drag a bit . <sssss> of course griffith strongly as usual , too . <sssss> one fault that some critics have flagged that i do not necessarily agree with is griffith 's insertion of comedy relief . <sssss> in many films of the era this did indeed mar films . <sssss> in ` way down east , ' though , the bumbling minor characters have a charm of their own and are naturally enough melded into the story that their actions do not seem to be at all intrusive to me . <sssss> vivia ogden as the gossip martha perkins is quite good and her interaction with seth holcomb -lrb- porter strong -rrb- , a old goat who always seems to be at the , is enjoyable . <sssss> we are told seth has followed her around for 20 years and she does n't seem to mind his attention . <sssss> shy ` professor ' creighton hale is amusing at times , flirting clumsily with both martha and the squire 's niece kate -lrb- mary hay . <sssss> -rrb- perhaps rolly polly hired hand hi holler -lrb- edgar nelson -rrb- could be dispensed with , but his screen time is limited and not a distraction . <sssss> the music is at times heavy handed , but is appropriate in mood setting -- including the forays into comic relief . <sssss> true , this is a potboiler melodrama with some heavy-handed griffith preaching . <sssss> still , it also includes griffith 's famed build-up of intensity and speed as the climax is neared . <sssss> it is also pictorially attractive , with snow-covered new england countrysides and landscapes . <sssss> also , gish and barthelmess never looked better . <sssss> as other have noted , gish by 1920 had fully come into her own as an actress and could make a very strong argument for being the best of all silent screen actresses . <sssss> there are other silent films much easier to sit through in their entirety . <sssss> this one is worth the effort , though . <sssss> griffith , warts and all , could tell a good story .

ur10489484/		\tt0012408		4		from time to time it 's very advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent film about the harsh life of the common people in order to remind themselves of the privileges and the comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even before ... in comparison with the complicated and hard work that common people have to endure everyday since the aristocrats rule the world . <sssss> and that 's what happens in `` the love light '' , the first film directed by dame france marion who will be famous afterwards in the silent and talkie world thanks overall to her work as a screenwriter ; better for her , certainly , because her career as a film director does n't impress this german count . <sssss> the film tells the story of dame angela -lrb- dame mary pickford -rrb- a merry italian girl who lives surrounded by a `` picturesque squalor '' -lrb- an important difference of opinion between upper and low classes ; aristocrats prefers to live surrounded by `` picturesque luxury '' ... -rrb- ; she has two brothers and a secret admirer but all she gives him in return is indifference . <sssss> destiny begins to work hard and pretty soon war is declared and dame angela 's two brothers enlist and in the next reel both are dead . <sssss> but destiny is even and dame angela meanwhile falls in love with ... a german !! <sssss> and to make things worse , she does n't know that her teutonic sweetie is a spy and that the light signals that she sends to him every night from the lighthouse she maintains thinking that is a love signal , do n't mean `` ich liebe dich '' but `` sink any damn italian boat at sea '' ... fortunately for dame angela , pretty soon her sweetie german spy will be found by the neighbours in her house in which she was hiding him -lrb- a not strange fact , indeed , because it is not an easy task for a german to go unnoticed ... -rrb- but the german spy will prefer to die before being captured by those italians . <sssss> from that german love , a baby will born -lrb- the wicked destiny at full speed ... -rrb- but a greedy neighbour who has a particular idea of motherhood will carry away her son with the consent of a catholic nun who has taken the council of trent to extremes ... a fact that will put dame angela at the verge of insanity . <sssss> but meanwhile dame angela 's secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that finally dame angela 's sorrowful life will improve ; a tremendous mistake because destiny has in store for her that the returned soldier is blind . <sssss> but as they say in germany , it may be a blessing in disguise and finally dame angela will recover her son and will start a new life with her blind sweetie in a poor italian village in what it is supposed to be a happy ending for the common people . <sssss> as this german count said before , it was much better for dame frances marion that she continued her career as a screenwriter , because as can be seen in `` the love light '' , she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories , ja wohl ! <sssss> ... but a completely different subject is to direct films and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm in spite of the effort of dame pickford to involve the audience with her many disgraces . <sssss> the nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the spectator making this the kind of film where only dame pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances . <sssss> and now , if you 'll allow me , i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must send morse signals from the schloss north tower to one of his teutonic rich heiress .

ur2467618/		\tt0012408		5		this movie is one of the most aesthetically pleasing films of the silent era . <sssss> it 's very artfully done and just looks great . <sssss> the problem for me , though , that kept this movie from scoring higher was its plot . <sssss> the film seemed to be like two short films fused together and they were just too different that the overall package just did n't seem very coherent . <sssss> mary pickford plays an italian woman who falls for a sailor who washes up on the beach during wwi . <sssss> they are secretly married and all seems fine until she discovers that this american is actually a german spy ! <sssss> and , it turns out , he 's responsible for her brother 's death . <sssss> okay . <sssss> well he 's killed in a really cool scene and then the movie switches to mary and her baby that is born months later . <sssss> another woman who just lost a baby covets mary 's and steals it . <sssss> in the big conclusion , mary burns her own house down when the light at the lighthouse fails to help save the ship with the stolen baby on board . <sssss> the lady thief drowned , but the baby is fine . <sssss> the end . <sssss> if you feel confused by the odd plot , you are not alone . <sssss> it 's just too confusing and loses some focus along the way . <sssss> it should have either dwelled much more on her relationship with the spy or skipped this entirely and focused on the lost baby . <sssss> together , the film is just too disparate to make much sense and seems too melodramatic and manipulative .

ur8989630/		\tt0012532		6		this film demonstrates griffith 's genius in creating a massive scale and in linking disparate plot elements . <sssss> by 1921 , however , some of griffith 's innovations had become mere mannerisms , particularly the cross-cutting that leads to his climax , as introduced in `` birth of a nation '' and used , with powerful effect , in `` hearts of the world . '' <sssss> the cross-cutting at the end of `` orphans '' goes on much too long . <sssss> lillian gish must have grown old staring down into the basket . <sssss> some techniques -- a blank screen followed by a face -lrb- memory -rrb- and a narrow focus on a face -lrb- point of view -rrb- , for example , are still effective . <sssss> i know that is a staple of the silent screen , but at times , it is over-the-top here . <sssss> , for example , the more subtle approach of an actor like alice terry . <sssss> danton did argue for moderation , once he believed that the revolution had succeeded . <sssss> his oration in this film is , like much of it , simply unbelievable . <sssss> the idyllic ending also strains credulity . <sssss> how did this particular group of aristocrats escape the blade and retire to a country estate ? 
ur0306861/		\tt0012532		10		two orphans of the storm caused by the french revolution desperately search for each other in the violent chaos of paris . <sssss> history 's sweeping drama comes alive in this powerful epic film from legendary silent movie genius d. w. griffith . <sssss> although much happens on a broad canvas , the director never loses sight of the intimate details of the heroines ' pitiful plight . <sssss> in denouncing tyranny , griffith always manages to keep the viewer engrossed in how the state 's insidious evil affects the individual . <sssss> much of the film 's success is due to the remarkable acting of the gish sisters , lillian & dorothy . <sssss> acclaimed for her comedic talents , dorothy here gives an almost completely serious performance , portraying a blind girl cruelly separated from her beloved sister and forced to beg in the streets . <sssss> lillian , her classic face mirroring a myriad of emotions , plays the sibling persecuted by both lecherous aristocrats and rapacious revolutionaries . <sssss> the scene in which lillian , in an upper chamber , hears dorothy singing in the alley below but is unable to reach her , is almost unbearable in its emotional intensity . <sssss> a young joseph schildkraut plays lillian 's blue-blooded suitor , giving the viewer an intimation of the very fine character actor he would become with the advent of talking pictures . <sssss> lucille laverne steals more than a few scenes as the filthy harridan who enslaves and terrorizes dorothy . <sssss> frank puglia makes a poignant mark as miss laverne 's pathetic , downtrodden son . <sssss> comic actor creighton hale gives a lively performance in a small role as a mischievous , servant . <sssss> a fascinating aspect of the film is its vivid rendering of two historical characters of great significance in the history of france . <sssss> georges danton was probably not as noble as he is portrayed by monte blue , nor was maximilien robespierre necessarily as evil as sidney herbert depicts him . <sssss> what is certain is that both men were responsible for the deaths of thousands of individuals during the reign of terror . <sssss> fittingly , each man had his own rendezvous with madame le guillotine in 1794 . <sssss> movie mavens will recognize an unbilled louis wolheim as the executioner awaiting miss lillian on the scaffold . <sssss> griffith handles the sequences involving surging masses of extras with admirable dexterity . <sssss> he also freely borrows a few plot elements from dickens ' a tale of two cities . <sssss> in fact miss laverne , with scarcely a costume change , would play the role of the vengeance in mgm 's 1935 version of that classic , violent novel .

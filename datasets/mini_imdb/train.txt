ur4939636/		\tt0000246		7		french film pioneer georges méliès began his career as a filmmaker in 1896 , just a few months after watching motion pictures for the first time in his life . <sssss> being a stage magician himself , he quickly noticed the enormous potential the new invention had as a form of entertainment , and immediately after the show made an offer to buy the lumières ' cinématographe . <sssss> the brothers refused , but that did n't stop méliès , who decided to make his own devises based on the brother 's work and the camera . <sssss> soon he was making his own short movies , and while at first he copied the themes the lumières had in their actuality films , he also started to make short fiction movies , often comedies and fantasy films . <sssss> his movies would become legendary when he started to use his discoveries in the field of special effects in his films , earning himself the nickname of `` cinemagician '' due to the spectacular effects of his fantasy tales . <sssss> while famous for his tales of fantasy , horror and science fiction , many of méliès ' early films were shorts about him , the magician , making an impossible trick on camera . <sssss> `` l' fin de siècle '' -lrb- literally , `` the impressionist of the end of the century '' , although better known as `` a turn of the century illusionist '' -rrb- , is one of those short movies , as the film is about a magician -lrb- méliès -rrb- making a supernatural trick of disappearance . <sssss> first , the magician makes a doll come to life to be his assistant -lrb- probably his wife -rrb- , and then makes her to vanish in thin air . <sssss> then , the magician lifts a barrel that he has on a table and the woman appears inside . <sssss> after that , the magician turns his assistant into confetti before covering himself with the same magic blanket he used before . <sssss> but that 's not all , after the magician disappears , a series of fantastic tricks transformations will take place as the magician is able now to transform himself into his assistant . <sssss> across his career , méliès made many of this kind of `` gimmick films '' , both to test his own tricks and to add some variety to his screenings . <sssss> as one of those movies , `` l' fin de siècle '' is entirely based on the stop trick to make the illusion of things transforming and vanishing . <sssss> it is certainly not the most sophisticated of his many tricks , but among his early films it is in this movie where his stop trick looks the best . <sssss> in 1899 it was definitely a complicated trick to do at high speeds , but méliès achieves a very fluid work of editing that allows him to use it even when his characters are running and jumping without looking too fake . <sssss> the effects of the many disappearances , done in his purest stage magician style , are still amazing even now , more than 100 years after the shooting of the movie . <sssss> `` l' fin de siècle '' is probably not the most impressive of the cinemagician 's films , but like most of his movies , it carries that special something , that magic that makes them so fun to watch . <sssss> 1899 would be an important year of many changes for méliès , as it was that year when he released his classic , `` '' -lrb- `` cinderella '' -rrb- , and started his most popular period . <sssss> both as an experiment and as a charming entertainment , `` l' fin de siècle '' is a very successful film and offered a glimpse of what the cinemagician had in the bag . <sssss> 7/10

ur2467618/		\tt0000272		6		okay , before you think i am crazy for giving this very brief and not altogether good film a score of 6 , understand that in 1900 most of the films lasted only a minute or so and they were amazingly mundane -- though at the time , they were seen as amazing and were the height of entertainment . <sssss> so , for a film from 1900 , this one is actually a bit above average and still is mildly amusing when seen today . <sssss> a dirty old man is seen sitting outside a shop . <sssss> he 's peering through a telescope at a woman 's ankle -lrb- what a horrid beast -rrb- . <sssss> and , when her husband finds out , he attacks the harmless old coot . <sssss> pretty sexy stuff in 1900 , but today it just seems quaint and silly . 
ur0805697/		\tt0000272		8		this comic short has a similar plot to smith 's previous ` grandma 's reading glass ' - a male protagonist looks at the world through the eyes of an optical instrument . <sssss> where the visions of the first film , however , were appropriate to a young boy - curious , novel , fresh , surprising ways of looking at the world as if for the first time -lrb- e.g. like the first cinema goers -rrb- , the development of an individual consciousness as it were - the point of view in this film is typical of an aged lecher , as he at the incipient sexual tease performed by a man and a woman as he ties up her shoelace , slowly raising her long dress to reveal a titillating glimpse of leg . <sssss> the move here from the encyclopaedic to the sexual and voyeuristic may be symptomatic of the ` wrong ' turning taken by cinema , bemoaned by the likes of godard , away from a curious interest in the world to vulgar , voyeuristic , prurient . <sssss> but smith is no fool , and the clatter the receives from one of his ` victims ' is given to us too - we are no better than this pervert . <sssss> the set-up cries out for voyeurism - a distanced shot of an environment offers us a brief glimpse of the couple in the background - the only way we can learn more is with the aid of this man 's instrument , significantly more phallic that grandma 's female lens . <sssss> there is no distortion here , as was the case with the first film , but clarification , a feeling of being close to the action , but apart from it : enjoyment without risk , the dream of every voyeur . <sssss> in a sense , this simple plot - voyeur attacked by the man he spies on - foreshadows one of the great masterpieces of cinema and the ultimate analysis of cinematic voyeurism and the invasion of privacy , ` rear window ' . <sssss> the man 's instrument may be phallic , but it is and sterile , especially in comparison to the fertile sexual relations presumably to be enjoyed at a later date by the couple . <sssss> the cinematic gaze is already being made negative , anti-social , hidden , something to be punished , something unhealthy , anti-family , solitary . <sssss> the watcher must be watched , controlled , as the victim 's punitive action suggests . <sssss> but it 's not that simple . <sssss> the framing circle of the close-up is linked to the circles of the wheels and pedals of the bicycle , maybe even the circle of life that this courtship intimates , just as jeff 's voyeurism is framed against his reluctance to settle down with his girlfriend . <sssss> a surprisingly ambiguous , analytical piece of self-reflexive cinema .

ur29418186/		\tt0000353		8		it 's hard to rate a film on a scale of one to ten , when the film is only three minutes long , black and white , silent , but a historical reenactment of the execution of president mckinley 's assassin . <sssss> on a level of historical importance , this film probably deserves a ten , it is stunning to the viewer 's eye in the opening moments when we get to see the outside of the actual prison . <sssss> fade to the indoors of the prison , we are treated with some slow-moving action in the form of guards bringing leon czolgosz to his death . <sssss> i was under the impression that this film was of the actual execution when i first came across it , but a little reading lets us know it is a faithful reenactment . <sssss> it comes off as how you would imagine a real execution would look like , but is really only truly notable because of the people involved -lrb- thomas edison and edwin s. porter -rrb- and the impact they would make on endless films of the future . <sssss> in that case , the film is truly revolutionary , it is only three to four minutes long depending on how many frames per second you 're watching it at , so you can watch it without having to worry about it being a time-waster . <sssss> of course it is n't though , it 's a fascinating spectacle on many different levels . <sssss> execution of czolgosz with panorama of auburn prison ----- 8/10 .

ur0805697/		\tt0000355		8		this exciting rescue drama is a film milestone , the first to use an edited series of interlocking scenes to create a narrative . <sssss> one would have been blase about this in 1903 , never mind a century later ; look at the early films consecutively , however , noticing how they develop basic film grammar , and the effect is thrilling , cutting from the fireman and victim moving from inside the house to outside on the ladder , a telling glimpse of cinema 's power and immediacy . <sssss> the plot 's simple enough - a house goes on fire and the firemen come to quench it and rescue the inhabitants . <sssss> the fascination lies in the details . <sssss> the way the fire 's smoke swirls and obscures the view , a subversive element that undermines cinema 's clarity , it 's claim to record things - the firemen are not just extinguishing a fire , or restoring order , the primacy of property and family , but retrieving cinema 's purpose , which here betrays interesting tensions . <sssss> the preparations of the firemen , laborious because the engine is still horse-drawn , and the animals are a little stroppy - the proud of a very phallic wheeled ladder is startling , suggesting that hazards to the social order can only be solved by the men that run it . <sssss> the gallop through gorgeous turn of the 20th century brighton streets , eerily old -lrb- to us -rrb- and empty , the horses speeding towards the camera before veering to avoid it . <sssss> the fire itself - the not very patriarchal hysteria of the father who just cries like a big girl without doing anything practical , particularly surprising when we discover he has a wife and child . <sssss> after he is rescued he waits in panic for someone : when his child is brought out and restored to him , the or -lrb- sic ? <sssss> -rrb- of the father is unusual for the period . <sssss> we assume his wife is dead , as he wanders off the screen , removing his child from the bourgeois that suddenly became so treacherous . <sssss> when we see the wife rescued to her family 's general indifference , it 's shocking . <sssss> the breach in the film 's form from the documentary-like preparations and rescue , and the flagrant artifice of the interior settings and the wild overacting results in an interesting tension that filmmakers like murnau , welles and godard would later explore , and which echoes the film 's ideological tensions , the vulnerability of the bourgeois myth . <sssss> rounding off this brilliant film is the closing scene , a long shot of the smoking house with the firemen below it . <sssss> there appears to be a huge peeling of the wall 's paint , suggesting the house 's age , which is visually startling , a visual violence matching the destructive fire . <sssss> we discover that this is actually water from the hose - so that the saviours within the narrative create a breach in the film 's form .

ur22384056/		\tt0000439		10		i do n't really think that you could say that , considering that this film is only about 10-15 minutes long , but i can nevertheless see why it is considered to be so legendary . <sssss> why is it considered to be so legendary may someone ask . <sssss> the explanation is that this was considered to be the first major motion picture . <sssss> while the short looks a little cheap in a few spots , i can still see perfectly why this is considered to be such a legendary piece of film . <sssss> i watched this movie just last night , and while i ca n't really say much about it , i can say that i was delighted by its significance and importance to the history of film . <sssss> let 's see , here are a few reasons . <sssss> along with being the first major motion picture , this was made by thomas edison . <sssss> and also , let 's not forget the famous final shot , in which someone shoots directly at the camera . <sssss> little did everyone know that this would help inspire the famous gun barrel sequence in the james bond movies . <sssss> and to me , that is extremely important considering the fact that i am an extremely huge fan of the james bond films . <sssss> there are also a few more reasons to the significance of this film , but i 'm not going to name them all , because it would take too long . <sssss> well anyway , this film is an important piece of film history , if you have n't seen it already , then take the time to see it , because you will see why it 's considered to be such a landmark in the history of film , and hey , it is a land mark in the history of film ! <sssss> 10/10 
ur1616919/		\tt0000439		7		the great train robbery is one of the landmark films in the development of narrative cinema . <sssss> it tells the story of a group of bandits who climb aboard a train and rob it ; they make their escape and are then chased by law enforcers and end up in a shoot-out . <sssss> up until this film , cinema was mainly at best a means of depicting visual trickery . <sssss> what this movie did that was revolutionary was to tell a relatively complex story involving a number of different locations . <sssss> of course , from a modern perspective it is as simple as can be , but in the early years of the medium it just was n't immediately obvious how to use this new technology to tell a story . <sssss> it took a while for early audiences to understand what techniques such as cross-cutting actually meant . <sssss> this film was extremely important in putting together some of the early basic cinematic story-telling devices in a way audiences could comprehend . <sssss> and not only that , it introduced , via its story of a group of bandits robbing a train , some of the key ingredients that would go on to form an indelible part of genre cinema . <sssss> the film ends on a scene that was more in keeping with the more gimmicky films of the time , when we are confronted with an actor who fires his gun directly at the camera , or at the audience . <sssss> i imagine this would 've caused a bit of consternation among some of the earlier cinema-goers . <sssss> despite this being the most famous part of the film , it 's only fair to say that the great train robbery is much more significant as a key work in the development as cinema as a narrative medium . <sssss> it 's enormously important in the history of cinema .

ur0562732/		\tt0000439		10		the great train robbery was filmed only a couple of years into the 20th century , and when you watch it , its age is quite obvious . <sssss> however , when you watch movies like this , you need to transport yourself back to the time period in which it was created and kind of watch the film through eyes that have n't been subjected to spectacularly visual films like the matrix or terminator 2 . <sssss> edwin porter made a ground-breaking film with the great train robbery . <sssss> sure , the scenes were very simple and the film is so blurry that you ca n't make out a single face -lrb- this is also a result of the total lack of close-up shots -rrb- , but in 1903 people watched this film and were stunned . <sssss> it was hugely successful because it was one of the first films in the world to be made that actually told a story . <sssss> previously , films were made mainly to show off the technology of the `` moving picture , '' and the public loved them because they had never seen such a thing before . <sssss> but when porter came along with the great train robbery , the path of motion pictures changed dramatically because people began to realize that these films could tell stories just as well as they could show water lapping on the beach or factory workers getting off of work or people jumping into a lake . <sssss> these were the type of films that were made in the 1890s and early 1900s . <sssss> the great train robbery is an extremely short film , but it is an interesting story that is made even more fascinating because of the fact that everything that happens on the screen happened nearly 100 years ago . <sssss> it 's like looking at a piece of history . 
ur4532636/		\tt0000439		8		it 's hard to assign `` the great train robbery '' a rating , as it should n't really be watched as a film the way we watch films now . <sssss> but from a historical perspective , it 's fascinating , and is an excellent example of the use of film editing , an art form then in its infancy and now an award category recognized every year at the oscars . <sssss> before this movie , it was n't customary to tell multiple story lines simultaneously , but here , various activities going on in different locations are intercut to create suspense . <sssss> d.w. griffith would use this technique much more ambitiously -lrb- and combine it with many other developing film techniques -rrb- in `` the birth of a nation '' over ten years later , but credit must be given to `` train robbery '' for blazing a trail . <sssss> also , this is the movie famous for the shot of an outlaw shooting a gun directly at the camera . <sssss> i ca n't imagine what effect this had on audiences at the time , who were probably diving behind their chairs for cover . <sssss> grade : a 
ur0322475/		\tt0000439		10		this film was made in 1903 and was the longest one to date : twelve minutes . <sssss> it has a clearly identifiable plot and this is that a band of four outlaws wreak havoc on two trains and the people on them . <sssss> they are rather skilled criminals but , in the end , ... this movie is a must-see if you are interested in the dawn of the cinematographic age . 
ur4834714/		\tt0000439		10		an 11 minute action ride that is now 107 years old . <sssss> silent movies have a place in my heart , by demonstrating the medium in its purest form . <sssss> the great train robbery even avoids using dialog cards . <sssss> most scenes are shot from one position , locked down and motionless . <sssss> this enables the scenes to unfold , but also keeps us at a distance . <sssss> it also allows for humor , such as the swap from human to dummy , and the passengers constantly exiting a train into a single shot . <sssss> it 's a wonderful film , with some surprising violence for its time . <sssss> you can see the evolution of cinema before your eyes , as editing , pacing and action join forces for this early gem . 
ur9247554/		\tt0000439		7		for my money , i enjoyed `` trip to the moon '' -lrb- 1902 -rrb- a little more for its fanciful special effects and imagination . <sssss> however , i can see why this was such a popular movie for its time - especially considering the many cinema innovations this film created . <sssss> my favorite `` version '' of the film now floating around has to be with the added gunshot sounds in the final scene . <sssss> point-blank looking right at the camera and firing ... takes a lot more to freak out an audience these days . <sssss> one of the `` 1,001 movies to see before you die '' , you can check this one off quickly , as it runs around 10 minutes . <sssss> the timeless storytelling , the heated gunfights and the historic value make this a keeper . 
ur20748638/		\tt0000439		10		it 's a simple story surrounding the amazing `` the great train robbery '' . <sssss> a group of bad guys robbing a train and killing everyone on their way . <sssss> but the movie has something more . <sssss> we can look to this picture and think of how much cinema evolved all these years but still think that this film was the source of inspiration of many other films . <sssss> to name one , martin scorsese 's `` goodfellas '' the last scene where joe pesci fires a gun towards the screen is a great homage to the exact last scene of `` the great train robbery '' and this scene was so impressive at the time -lrb- 1903 -rrb- that the people in the audience feared for their lives as they thought that the bullets of the gun would hit them all . <sssss> the narrative was very original -lrb- one of the first films to deal with the theme of violence -rrb- , director edwin porter made a oustanding western that should be considered the first great western ever made -lrb- i do n't know if there 's older westerns than this -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm a enthusiast when it comes to the early days of films because many times this classics are more interesting than today 's odd and fast flicks . <sssss> we watch films like `` a trip to the moon '' and `` the great train robbery '' and keep thinking how in the world the people involved with it made such advanced techniques e.g. the use of color in some scenes -lrb- the girl with the yellow dress and everyone 's dancing with her are filmed in black-and-white -rrb- . <sssss> today this film might not be a thrilling movie and actually there 's some funny moments involving the robbers 's victims getting shot -lrb- the most hilarious moment comes when they kill a guy on the train and then they throw the guy 's out and you can see that the guy was replaced by a. . <sssss> . <sssss> doll ! <sssss> i could n't hold myself during this part -rrb- but nonetheless it is a great accomplish and it 's very enjoyable to see . <sssss> an interesting experience to see . <sssss> search on the net , it 's part of the public domain . <sssss> 10/10 
ur22191726/		\tt0000439		10		i watched this movie a while ago . <sssss> i thought that it was very interesting because it has such a remarkable history behind it . <sssss> back in the time of edison manufacturing company , the films that it made such as the great train robbery and 1910 's frankenstein were probably considered scary . <sssss> it 's hard to believe now , but both of those are still good to watch in my opinion because they kind of started the western and horror film genre . <sssss> i find it very interesting to watch the old edison company films just to see how motion pictures started . <sssss> in short , even though this was made in 1903 and is only about 10 or 15 minutes long , it 's worth watching at least once .

ur4939636/		\tt0000439		8		even with a runtime of barely 12 minutes , director edwin s. porter 's `` the great train robbery '' stands as a milestone of the history of cinema and the film that set the basis for the narrative elements that would be developed further by d. w. griffith and other future filmmakers . <sssss> along with the work by french director georges méliès -lrb- whom porter owes more than a few tricks -rrb- , porter 's film continues cinema 's evolution from mere plays captured on film towards a full-fledged form of art in its own way . <sssss> the film is the story of a gang of four criminals -lrb- broncho billy , justus d. barnes , john manus dougherty and frank hanaway -rrb- and their attempt to rob a train . <sssss> after they succeed on their crime a little girl -lrb- mary snow -rrb- discovers them and notifies the sheriff -lrb- a.c. -rrb- , who decides to capture the criminals . <sssss> of course , the plot is probably a very simple story by today 's standards , but it was something never seen before on its time , and it marked the birth of the western film genre . <sssss> the plot is told in a normal linear way , however , with this film porter crafted the first important narrative film in the u.s. and gave the american industry the impulse needed to grow up . <sssss> after learning many of his tricks from méliès ' films , porter combines everything he learned and develops many editing techniques that would help in the evolution of cinema as a narrative art . <sssss> while many of the scenes are still shot in a way similar to plays , it introduces shots where the camera plays an important role , being more than just a way to capture the action and becoming an active factor in the creation of the scene itself . <sssss> while it 's technical advances are on enormous importance , `` the great train robbery '' also introduced one of the very first movie stars in history : broncho bill . <sssss> probably this film is not the best way to appreciate his talent , but it was just the beginning of the western as a genre and of broncho bill 's career as film 's most successful cowboy . <sssss> probably justs d. barnes was not as lucky as bill , but the final shot in `` the great train robbery '' is nowadays an iconic image of silent films and the best remembered scene of the short film . <sssss> while d. w. griffith is considered the first proper filmmaker , it 's very interesting and awe-inspiring to watch the films that led to cinema as we know it . <sssss> like méliès ' works , porter 's films were of tremendous influence due to the many techniques he combined , changing forever the conception of cinema and turning it in an art on its own right . <sssss> `` the great train robbery '' , the first western film ever made , it 's a landmark that everyone interested in the history of film-making must give a look . <sssss> 8/10 
ur1601212/		\tt0000439		3		edwin porter 's 1903 short film entitled `` the great train robbery '' bursts onto the screen with so much excitement and ingenuity that one prepares to be blown away by another pioneering early film . <sssss> just like melies ' `` a trip to the moon '' , critics have hailed this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema . <sssss> in my eyes , they were right . <sssss> it had everything from the planning , the actual heist of the train , the murder of an unwanted civilian , and that looming final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business -- it was all monumental for its time . <sssss> from here to eastwood , every western filmmaker has used porter 's image in some form or another to create their own story . <sssss> one can not say that this film did n't open the door , but the struggle comes from the story itself . <sssss> the genre was defined by porter , but outside of its initial excitement -- there really is n't anything to grapple onto . <sssss> perhaps i am jaded by the cliché modern westerns and their haphazard messages , but how can something be cliché before being cliché ? <sssss> to me , `` the great train robbery '' seemed forced , untraceable , and unsurprising . <sssss> unlike melies , porter tells a very linear story . <sssss> robbers change the course of a train , rob it , then shoot at random people just to prove they are the true villains , and the final scene ends like any predestined film , without any surprises or glitches , and that looming man with a gun to your proverbial face . <sssss> it is bland . <sssss> porter 's film is boring . <sssss> in the edition i watched , there was an addition of color near to the end to emphasize emotion , which felt cheap and was not encouraging to the filmmaker , or to the viewer . <sssss> the issue remains that while it is important , porter 's film has been borrowed time and time again , it has in effect become diluted . <sssss> the story itself does not carry the emotional powerhouse it once has . <sssss> unlike melies early film , i can not watch this again . <sssss> i know what has happened , i know there is very little missing from behind the scenes , and that finally it is just what it has set out to be -- a simple story leading from point a to point b to point c . <sssss> this issue is not only my gripe with this film , but also the strongest element to see in such an early film . <sssss> while it was dull , the fact that it told such a strong narrative -- that our characters were characters with motives and drives , was outstanding to see . <sssss> in an era where nonfiction films seemed mainstream , this broke the mold . <sssss> again , not that i am jumping on the prophetic bandwagon about this film -- it is an important film -- it just is n't a great film . <sssss> overall , i was eager to jump into this film to see where the roots of the western genre were planted , but i was equally as happy to leave this film behind . <sssss> porter is a talented director , and g.m. anderson obviously went on to be very successful in the created field , but i just was n't in awe of the film . <sssss> i was n't expecting big budget effects like melies work , nor was i expecting a duplicate of `` a trip to the moon '' , but i did want to see the same creativity , exploration , and originality . <sssss> i felt porter played it safe , if that can be said with such an early film , but i could n't feel the excitement as our villains did their evil deeds . <sssss> i was n't rooting for anyone , and the final conclusion proved that the of it had worn off minutes after the film started . <sssss> it was pioneering , but not monumental . <sssss> `` the great train robbery '' has lost its space in the time capsule of cinema . <sssss> grade : ** out of ***** 
ur4248714/		\tt0000439		7		this is one of the most significant films in cinema history , it is the second -lrb- after a trip to the moon - 1902 -rrb- to feature in the book 1001 movies you must before you die . <sssss> basically a clerk of a train station is assaulted and left tied up by four bandits , and they proceed to carry out the great train robbery robbery of the title . <sssss> they line up all passengers of the train , after the passenger cars from the engine , and take all wallets and money from them . <sssss> quickly they get in the engine , go forward a bit , and then run out to ride away on some horses , and then they enter a saloon , forcing people at gunpoint to dance , before a final shoot-out , where the robbers are killed . <sssss> the iconic image of this film is the final shot where a moustached bandit faces the audiences and shoots , disappearing in the cloud of smoke . <sssss> it may a bit shaky and black and white , but it is an important film , as it was the first ever western , i think it was the first to feature guns , and of course , it was the first to feature both heroes and villains , as 100 years , 100 heroes & villains explained . <sssss> very good !

ur23179345/		\tt0000439		5		the great train robbery is an interesting little silent film barely over ten minutes long which details the robbery of a train by a group of outlaws and then retaliation by the posse sent out to capture the outlaws . <sssss> while the film is alittle underwhelming from a modern day perspective i would argue that the film is important historically and can be seen as the precursor to the modern western genre and as far as i know is the first film to break the fourth wall -lrb- when the cowboy shoots the audience in the beginning of the film -rrb- . <sssss> furthermore , the camera work and editing was unique for the time in which it was filmed . <sssss> that being said i would only recommend this film to film history buffs or silent film enthusiasts . 
ur0474103/		\tt0000439		10		this was a ground-breaking film in several ways ... the first western , the first movie to tell a complete story , the first movie to utilize special effects which still stand up -lrb- somewhat -rrb- today ! <sssss> other reviewers ' comments would be repeated if i elaborated much further on this film , but i would like to point out that this is the film seen by richard farnsworth in the grey fox , inspiring him to abandon robbing stagecoaches for trains . <sssss> catch both of these films if you can !!!! <sssss> a 10 from me ! 
ur1048771/		\tt0000439		6		it 's almost impossible to review a twelve minute western made in 1903 from a modern standpoint and a knowledge of all the western classics that would follow . <sssss> but since director porter had to work with primitive technology , his little film still impresses today . <sssss> a touch that seems inspired is having the gunsmoke and occasional spurts of dust tinted red , as well as the final shot aimed at the screen -lrb- something alfred hitchcock may have borrowed for one of his films -rrb- . <sssss> briefly told , it 's the simple story of a train robbery that is almost successful until the four men are hunted by a posse . <sssss> a stationmaster is shot and tied up , while outside his window we see a train moving into the station -- a wobbly special effect ahead of its time . <sssss> the little girl who eventually removes his binds is amusing in the way she uses silent screen technique to indicate panic by looking upward with outstretched arms . <sssss> considering when it was made , it 's astonishing that the was able to do what he did here .

ur2286081/		\tt0000439		8		as the title of this summary states , this is one of the oldest films i 've ever seen . <sssss> but that does n't take away from how well it was made . <sssss> it 's probably the best film of the ' 00s and you 'll probably agree with me about that . <sssss> the plot is very simple , yet it 's very interesting too . <sssss> a clerk at a train station is held up by four bandits who are trying to rob a train . <sssss> they tie up the clerk and threaten the train operator . <sssss> then they take all the money from the train . <sssss> meanwhile , a little girl finds the clerk and warns the sheriff . <sssss> he forms a posse and an incredible climax occurs . <sssss> the last shot of the film is probably the most memorable and it 's been imitated many times . <sssss> i wo n't give it away because the film is so good , but i 'll say that when you see it , you 'll probably find yourself thinking that you can remember seeing that before . <sssss> the director , edwin s. porter , was more influential to me than d.w. griffith . <sssss> so that 's saying a lot about him because griffith is sometimes considered to be the father of full length feature films . <sssss> but i still say porter is up there with the best . <sssss> enjoy the great train robbery .

ur4234119/		\tt0000439		9		in 1895 , `` the arrival of a train at la ciotat '' , one of the early lumiere films , left an indelible impact on the minds of the first movie goers who wondered what was this ` cinematograph ' thing all about . <sssss> although it 's very unlikely that they screamed or ran away from the screen , there 's no doubt that the sight of a train pulled by a steam locomotive , coming at full-speed , much more in their direction , must have been quite an unforgettable experience . <sssss> and yet , that was only the beginning and i wonder what were people 's reactions , eight years later , when a menacing-looking outlaw fired point blank towards the camera . <sssss> did they have the reflex to duck ? <sssss> did they scream ? <sssss> or did they realize they were the privileged witnesses of the genesis of cinema as the most defining art of the twentieth century ? <sssss> i 'm naturally referring to the last iconic shot of `` the great train robbery '' , if not the first western movie ever made , the one that gained the first spot in historical posterity and would have certainly sunk into oblivion if it were n't for this last-second masterstroke . <sssss> like the title says , the film reconstructs the robbery of a train through a meticulous editing made of heart-pounding crosscutting and many creative uses of colors . <sssss> in ten minutes , the bandits force a railroad telegraph to stop the train at a water tank , they kill a messenger , open a box of valuables with dynamite , disconnect the locomotive , pull the passengers off the train , steal them , kill one who tries to escape , then escape in the locomotive and stop at a valley when they get their horses back . <sssss> finally , the telegraph 's daughter awakens him , a posse is formed and the villains are killed after a bloody gunfight . <sssss> it 's only a film of ten minutes but these ten minutes shook the world of cinema like the '10 days that shook the world ' during the bolshevik revolution . <sssss> well , in other words , `` the great train robbery '' is pure celluloid revolution . <sssss> indeed , the level of perfectionism involved in the recreation of the train robbery , with the maximum historical accuracy is n't much saying since 1903 was n't that far from the real-life western era , and watching the film is like turning yellowed dusty pages of a historical book . <sssss> to give you an idea , even the wild bunch or john mccabe could have watched the film . <sssss> but there is something so remarkably modern in its visual effects and so technically impeccable in its approach to action , to the recreation of the perfect widescreen shorts , the right angles , to every single movements from the protagonists , that it clearly shows the director edwin s. porter was a former cameraman from edison studios , he had an ` eye for action ' , and demonstrated that a director was more than a man to shout `` action '' but one to direct it like a dancer with a choreography . <sssss> and beyond the technical experiments , porter understood the importance of leaving a final impact on viewers and the fact that the last shot of justus d. barnes shooting at the audience does n't hold any connection with the previous scenes , and can only be interpreted as a free artistic license , shows that `` the great train robbery '' was n't just thought a sort of documentary-like recreation , or an action movie but also as a piece of art , which by the standards of that era , can be easily labeled as a masterpiece , it 's fresh , modern and so ... bad-ass . <sssss> `` the great train robbery '' sealed the fate of cinema as one of the most major forms of popular entertainments . <sssss> the few the film features planted the seeds of all the great realizations to come . <sssss> indeed , you have them all in `` robbery '' : `` the birth of a nation '' for the suspenseful crosscutting , hence leading us to hitchcock . <sssss> in content , the film is the ancestor of `` butch cassidy and the sundance kid '' or as a matter of fact , any caper or heist movie relating a criminal plot methodically constructed like `` bob le flambeur '' or `` reservoir dogs '' . <sssss> and naturally , you have joe pesci shooting at the end of `` goodfellas '' , or the gun barrel sequence in any james bond movies , even a bit of `` schindler 's list '' is present through the iconic little girl in red . <sssss> by the way , if porter was the first to taint some aspects of the film such as the explosions or women 's dress , i wonder if he tried to imply a dichotomy between lust and violence , well is n't that the whole purpose of movie-making summarized in the `` kiss kiss bang bang '' axiom ? <sssss> see , all the cinematic ways lead to `` robbery '' . <sssss> of course , not everyone would be overwhelmed by the film , or share the same reaction than its contemporary viewers . <sssss> some might even laugh at the sight of people reaching their arms and twirling around when they 're shot , but this is so futile compared to the film 's contribution to cinema . <sssss> every movie owes something to `` the great train robbery '' if only the fact that the film established the superiority of cinema as an art form meant to entertain people , to tell a story with an suspenseful set-up , a thrilling action and a powerful ending . <sssss> even `` the arrival of a train at la ciotat '' had the same basic ingredients a static shot working as a set-up , a surprising twist and the climactic moment where the train reaches lower edge of the screen , but it was not fiction , therefore creation . <sssss> and the content of `` the great train robbery '' is filmmaking in microcosm , focusing on its core , which is action , translated in greek by the word ` drama ' . <sssss> see , you have the core of film - making concentrated on this simple film and to judge `` the great train robbery '' is to comprehend its historical and artistic importance , immortalized by the iconic ` shot ' of barnes shooting at us , the new visage of cinema .

ur1617546/		\tt0000553		7		this sort of trick film , in which a traveler goes some place where things mysteriously happen , was not new when j. stuart blackton made it in 1907 . <sssss> melies was making stuff like it in 1896 . <sssss> and the vim and verve of his performances was a lot better than the actor 's here . <sssss> nonetheless , there was a change and advance in the decade and it was in the evolution of a film grammar . <sssss> in the earlier films , the point of the transformations , appearances , disappearances and things moving on their own was that they were happening . <sssss> they were the point of the movie and any actor on the screen stood in for the goggling audience . <sssss> it was a magic act . <sssss> this film , however , is more than that . <sssss> it is a story about a traveler who checks into a hotel and the weird and terrifying things that happen to him . <sssss> the things that happen -- knives that cut sausage without anyone holding them -- are not the point of the movie , they are means of achieving the point . <sssss> they have moved from simple shots to film vocabulary . <sssss> the vocabulary would remain the same , even though they grammar they exist in -- a cobbled-together pidgin of stage , magic lantern and ad hoc film usage -- would be swept away within half a decade . <sssss> however , the next time you look at a horror movie , take a look . <sssss> they 're still using the same tricks . 
ur0198397/		\tt0000682		10		what a film this is ! <sssss> the film is under two minutes , and i ca n't remember half of it . <sssss> i seem to remember a woman with a very large hat getting it pulled off , pants turning into umbrellas , men getting stabbed an dismembered , but still walking around , houses turning into elephants , and many other images . <sssss> cohl seemed to want to include every image he could think of in the film . <sssss> i 'm sure he had no idea of the legacy he would leave . <sssss> in fact , judging by the nature of the film , it 's almost as if , at the time , cohl thought he might be one of the only people on the planet who would ever be able to make drawings move like that . <sssss> even today , with all the technological advances in the field of animation , `` fantasmagorie '' is entertaining . <sssss> despite the fact that it has no plot or real point except to show off what animation can do , and despite the relative crudeness of the drawings , its relentless , violent energy , and short running time make it a joy to watch . <sssss> i would n't expect non-animation buffs to care much about it however . <sssss> they 'd probably enjoy it , but would have hard time understanding the fuss . 
ur10334028/		\tt0000682		6		émile cohl , a french caricaturist , is often described as `` the father of the animated cartoon . '' <sssss> considered the first film , his two-minute 1908 film ` fantasmagorie ' -lcb- alternatively , in english : ' a fantasy , ' ` black and white , ' or ` metamorphosis ' -rcb- is made up on approximately 700 drawings , using what is known as a `` effect '' -lrb- filming black lines on white paper , then reversing the negative to give the impression of white chalk on a black chalkboard -rrb- , a technique probably borrowed from early animator james stuart blackton . <sssss> a fast-paced , confusing and short film , ` fantasmagorie ' is loaded with dozens of tiny seconds-long scenes , which rapidly into the next , possibly a stylistic tribute to the short-lived , long-forgotten incoherent movement of the 1880s , of which cohl had been a part . <sssss> the title of the film itself is taken from the word `` , '' which referred to a magic lantern that could project ghostly images across walls . <sssss> not following any standard narrative , ` fantasmagorie ' is really quite difficult to follow . <sssss> the film starts with a hand quickly sketching a dangling clown , which instantly transforms into a large man in an elevator , which materialises into a man in a cinema whose view is suddenly blocked by a woman with a tall feathery hat . <sssss> this scene , probably the longest single sequence at about 20 seconds , shows the man desperately trying to glimpse the screen again by peeling away the feathers of the hat , only for the women 's head to suddenly expand into a large bubble for the next scene transition . <sssss> the remainder of the film is a hectic jumble of jumping about , fishing , sword-fighting , canons , flowers , milk bottles , elephants turning into houses and , for the grand finale , a character departing into the left-hand side of the screen on a horse . <sssss> i found ` fantasmagorie ' to be quite an interesting early short , though it moved much , much too quickly to be solidly enjoyable -lrb- j. stuart blackton made a much more accessible film two years earlier with ` humorous phases of funny faces ' -rrb- . <sssss> nonetheless , the film carries great historical importance in the field of animation , and cohl 's style undoubtedly influenced such animators as winsor mccay , perhaps most famous for his 1914 animated short film , ` gertie the dinosaur . ' 
ur2467618/		\tt0000682		8		if you are a lover of the history of cinema , then fantasmagorie is an absolute must -- particularly if you are interested in animation . <sssss> that 's because this short little film is the first animated film and considering everything , it 's a darn good one . <sssss> instead of the usual structure , style and narrative , this film is rather unique and free-flowing . <sssss> a series of drawings morph and change with no apparent rhyme or reason . <sssss> in many ways , it 's more like a work of art than a traditional cartoon and it 's all done in black and white . <sssss> it must have taken a very , very long time to make and for 1908 , it 's an incredible little film . <sssss> sure , films made just a few years later would make this seem obsolete , but given the context , it 's a grand little film . 
ur11228318/		\tt0000682		10		emile cohl 's fantasmagorie is perhaps one of the earliest film depictions of animation , in this case it 's chalk drawings on a black board morphing from one scene to another without any real connection except for the way lines keep moving to any shape or form cohl can think of . <sssss> and it all happens in the space of two minutes ! <sssss> so , historically , this is one of the most fascinating animated shorts ever . <sssss> audiences might have been even more awestruck then than we would be now what with all the improvements that have happened in the nearly one hundred years since then . <sssss> so for all of the above reasons , this short gets a 10 . 
ur4939636/		\tt0000749		7		in 1908 , a 34 year old playwright named d.w. griffith was having little success with his plays and decided to try his luck in the newly formed movie industry with an adaptation of `` tosca '' he intended to sell to the film studios of the edison manufacturing company . <sssss> the head of the studio at the time was film pioneer edwin s. porter , who was n't really impressed with griffith 's work as a writer but , since griffith was also an actor , porter decided to hire him and send him to director j. searle dawley . <sssss> a former theater director -lrb- he liked to called himself as `` the first professional motion picture director '' -rrb- , dawley immediately chose griffith for the main role in his new film : `` rescued from an eagle 's nest '' . <sssss> it would be in this early adventure film where d.w. griffith would have his first contact with the movie industry and where he would first learn the crafts that would make him a legendary filmmaker in the following years . <sssss> `` rescued from an eagle 's nest '' is the story of a woodsman 's family and the extraordinary adventure they live one day while the father -lrb- d.w. griffith -rrb- was outside working . <sssss> after the father leaves the house , the mother -lrb- miss earle -rrb- begins her own housework and leaves the child -lrb- frazer -rrb- outside to play . <sssss> while the mother is inside the cabin , a big eagle descends from the sky and takes the child away . <sssss> the mother notices the eagle kidnapping the kid , but it 's too late for her to save him , so she runs to the woods in order to tell her husband about it . <sssss> after hearing what has happened to his child , the lumberjack and his mates run together to the mountains . <sssss> when they find the nest , they discover that it 's very difficult to reach it , so the woodsman takes a rope with him and begins to climb down . <sssss> however , before returning home he 'll have to face the eagle that kidnapped his kid . <sssss> as usual with the early movies from the edison manufacturing company , it ca n't be known for sure who exactly wrote the screenplay of the film , but considering director j. searle dawley 's background , it is highly probable that it was all dawley 's creation expanding from one of his or porter 's ideas . <sssss> the story of `` rescued from an eagle 's nest '' is pretty simple and has almost no characterization , focusing on the action and adventure that the woodsman faces to save his kid . <sssss> in this sense , the movie works like a folktale put on film , as it is concerned more about the adventure in itself than about the characters . <sssss> while simple in its construction , the plot of `` rescued from an eagle 's nest '' remains so universal that is hard not to feel thrilled by the woodsman 's adventure . <sssss> in `` rescued from an eagle 's nest '' , director j. searle dawley truly shows a better understanding of the new options that film offered him as a narrative language , and moves further away from the idea that movies were simply plays on film . <sssss> the influence of edwin s. porter -lrb- who was in charge of cinematography in this movie -rrb- can be seen in many scenes as dawley employs several of the editing techniques that porter originated in his 1903 seminal classic , `` life of an american fireman '' -lrb- techniques that griffith would further develop in his own films -rrb- . <sssss> this is reflected in the very original ways the movie uses edition and its primitive special effects to play with action and suspense in order to thrill and surprise the audience . <sssss> by our standards , the effects look poor and clichéd , but it was definitely a step ahead in its time . <sssss> as written above , the film focuses entirely on the family 's adventure without leaving too much for character development , so it would be not only difficult but also unfair to judge the performances of the cast on those terms . <sssss> so considering that they were playing basically archetypes , it could be said that the whole cast was actually good , as there rarely was any overacting -lrb- so common in the early days of cinema -rrb- and everyone seemed to know what to do . <sssss> it is obviously interesting to see d.w. griffith as the woodsman , and his performance does n't disappoint . <sssss> his fight with the eagle is a very good scene that forecasts similar scenes in future action movies like the ones with douglas fairbanks . <sssss> even when she was not a professional actress -lrb- or probably because of that very reason -rrb- , miss earle is very good and looks very natural in her concern for her baby . <sssss> while the film still feels stagy at times , it was a step ahead in the development of the language of cinema that spawned an entire series of imitators that further developed the adventure genre -lrb- even griffith himself would use the same basic plot of a kidnapped child in his first movie , `` the adventures of dollie '' -rrb- . <sssss> to call this movie clumsy or uneven and judge it under our standards is criminally unfair , as while `` rescued from an eagle 's nest '' is not a perfect movie , it is not only actually very good for its time but it also helped to set the basis for the action and adventure films of today . <sssss> `` rescued from an eagle 's nest '' is not only a must see for griffith fans interested on his first work , it is also an amusing short movie for fans of early action movies and silent film in general . <sssss> 7/10 
ur0277301/		\tt0000749		5		in the 1930s the museum of modern art discovered an old print of this title and recognized director d.w. griffith as the young woodsman and the hero of this picture . <sssss> from griffith , moma got the idea that `` rescued from an eagle 's nest '' was his first film appearance , made in 1907 before he arrived at biograph . <sssss> the old man 's memory may have been playing tricks on him , as we know now that griffith joined biograph late in 1907 and `` rescued from an eagle 's nest '' was apparently the sole instance where griffith picked up a role outside of the biograph studio . <sssss> the experience must have been valuable to him , because -- unlike the hapless , inept and inexperienced wallace jr. at biograph -- porter and dawley were smart and efficient in making films , and griffith probably brought their practices into place when he finally replaced the younger mccutcheon at biograph . <sssss> i 'm not quite sure why established writing on `` rescued from an eagle 's nest '' always emphasizes how silly and banal this short is ; porter 's special effect of the eagle carrying away the baby is very well made for 1908 , and as the audience for this piece would have been mostly women and children , it would have doubtlessly been effective in their eyes . <sssss> the acting style may be a bit overwrought , but remember that the actors had to project from a distance , as it was still customary to present a stage-like perspective in motion pictures . <sssss> griffith himself would be one of the principal players in the art of that distance to help establish the language of cinema as something apart from the typical theatrical experience , but in january 1908 that was still in the future . <sssss> griffith 's one or two days spent working for edison can be seen as something that helped to ground the lofty actor in basic filmmaking , even if as an old man he did n't really remember much of the particulars regarding this shoot .

ur1609079/		\tt0001518		6		i saw `` broncho billy 's adventure '' -- an allegedly ` lost ' film -- in october 2006 at le giornate del cinema muto in sacile , italy . <sssss> this movie proves my point about so-called ` lost ' films : namely , that many film archives do n't know precisely what they 've got , and therefore nobody should claim definitively that a particular film no longer exists . <sssss> -lrb- unless every print of the film has been aggressively tracked and monitored throughout its distribution , as was very occasionally the case . <sssss> -rrb- the wonderful eastman house archive in rochester , ny , holds hundreds of reels of nitrate film which they 've not been able to restore , archive and catalogue , simply because they lack the funds and staff to do this job properly : as a result , they ca n't be certain of what ` lost ' treasures are in their possession . <sssss> sadly , many early films which were safely stored someplace have vanished anyway , because the highly unstable nitrate emulsion in their film stock has deteriorated . <sssss> the staff at eastman house -lrb- and other film archives -rrb- are desperately racing against time to transfer these images to stock before it deteriorates beyond retrieval . <sssss> i 've received some correspondence from people asking me to give them -lrb- or sometimes even demanding -rrb- access to some private film collections known to me , containing films which i 've occasionally been permitted to view before writing my imdb reviews . <sssss> to all you people who want ` lost ' films to become available , the remedy is simple : make a donation to eastman house or another archive , and help save an old movie ! <sssss> `` broncho billy 's adventure '' was one more film ` lost forever ' until late 2006 , when a staffer at eastman house opened a film canister that had no label , having genuinely no notion of what was inside . <sssss> it turned out to be feet of movie film starring one of america 's earliest cowboy stars . <sssss> miraculously , the film was discovered just on the brink of deterioration . <sssss> thank you , eastman house ! <sssss> several different cowboy actors each claimed to be the ` first ' western star . <sssss> one of the more valid claims for that honour was made by gilbert anderson , who appears to have been the first cowboy actor consistently to portray the same recurring character in a series of films , thus building audience familiarity and appeal . <sssss> his screen role was named broncho billy -lrb- for some reason he spelt this with an ` h ' , as in ` bronchitis ' -rrb- and the character was an instant hit with audiences . <sssss> anderson also had the bright idea of producing his own films and keeping the profits . <sssss> he teamed with george k to found the essanay film company . <sssss> -lrb- essanay = = and anderson , geddit ? <sssss> -rrb- anderson lured chaplin away from mack sennett 's keystone to make slightly more expensive films at essanay . <sssss> after chaplin left essanay for more money at mutual , he remained good friends with anderson ; this had not been the case at keystone when chaplin parted company with sennett . <sssss> in this instalment of his series , broncho billy rides into an unfamiliar town and stays at an hotel run by publican arthur . <sssss> his daughter -lrb- edna fisher -rrb- is the local beauty , and she has attracted quite an array of suitors : we see them -- tall , short , lanky , hefty -- queued up at the kitchen door . <sssss> eventually , gets into a fistfight with one swain -lrb- fred church -rrb- which enrages all the others , causing to become unpopular . <sssss> naturally , broncho billy saves the day before riding off into the sagebrush . <sssss> although anderson is playing his usual role as broncho billy here , the outing is somewhat of a change of pace for him because this time broncho billy plays cupid , arranging a rendezvous for fair edna and her favoured swain while holding off all his rivals . <sssss> we never expect billy to get the girl in this one , and indeed he does n't . <sssss> however , broncho billy 's regular fans , who expect to see him do some rootin ' - tootin ' shootin ' and some fisticuffs , wo n't be disappointed either : broncho billy gets into quite a bit of action here , and saves a couple of lives . <sssss> victor -lrb- another keystone alumnus -rrb- is funny here as one of the unsuccessful sagebrush johnnies . <sssss> augustus carney impressed me briefly in this movie , portraying a frontier sawbones . <sssss> when this film was made , carney was essanay 's biggest comedy star , appearing in a series of hugely successful ` ' comedies as a character cried alkali ike . <sssss> he was eventually lured away from essanay by universal 's carl laemmle , who insisted on renaming carney 's screen character universal ike . <sssss> at both studios , carney 's performances were generally broad and overacted , so i was intrigued to see him in `` broncho billy 's adventure '' playing a comparatively realistic character -lrb- for once -rrb- and proving himself to be an actor capable of some restraint and subtlety . <sssss> i 'm always delighted when any ` lost ' film returns from the dead , but westerns are hardly my favourite film fare . <sssss> i 'll rate this oater just 6 out of 10 , giving broncho billy some credit for varying his formula slightly . 
ur1617546/		\tt0001518		5		`` broncho billy '' varies his formula a bit , using some of his company from his `` '' comedy unit in a bit of romantic comedy with a touch of pathos as broncho billy acts as cupid for a young woman and her new boyfriend , whom the old one shoots . <sssss> there 's an air of pathos in this one -- billy , over hundreds of short westerns varied his formulas enough to keep his audience entertained . <sssss> unfortunately this resulted in a lack of character continuity , so to the modern viewer -- whom , one hopes , is educated in these silents -- each piece is pretty much on its own . <sssss> this one is all right , but not much more . <sssss> still , if you wish to see it for yourself , it 's available for viewing on the george eastman house website . 
ur1298724/		\tt0001593		6		taken in its entirety this short film ranks with the strongest dramas d.w. griffith made at biograph , notable for its understated acting and for cameraman billy bitzer 's beautifully composed images . <sssss> although it lacks the sort of bravura sequence that would become the director 's specialty , enoch arden has a stately melancholy atmosphere that lingers with the viewer long after it 's over . <sssss> historically speaking the film is also notable for the director 's early experiment with a longer running time . <sssss> one-reel works running about ten minutes were the standard product of the day , and the notoriously conservative executives who controlled the american biograph company opposed longer films and tried to discourage griffith from expanding past the one-reel format . <sssss> the likeliest reason was the same one hollywood executive cite today : longer movies mean fewer screenings daily , thus less profit . <sssss> -lrb- some things never change ! <sssss> -rrb- but when biograph released enoch arden in two parts , with instructions for exhibitors to play them on successive days , audiences objected and asked to see the entire film . <sssss> exhibitors bowed to public demand and the two-reel drama was born . <sssss> viewing part one of the film today it 's easy to see why audiences reacted as they did ; the first reel establishes a compelling , suspenseful situation involving sympathetic characters , but ends without resolving it . <sssss> for those viewers unfamiliar with the tennyson poem which served as the film 's source material this first portion is intriguing but ends inconclusively . <sssss> the story is set in an 18th century fishing village , and concerns a romantic triangle involving fisherman enoch arden , his girlfriend annie lee , and a wealthy rival named philip ray . <sssss> enoch wins the girl , they marry , and after a few years they have three children . <sssss> in order to provide for his young family enoch chooses to go to sea on a fishing vessel for an extended voyage , over the objections of annie lee . <sssss> when the ship founders , enoch and two other sailors make their way to an island , but his shipmates die , leaving enoch the sole survivor . <sssss> annie lee , meanwhile , anxiously watches for his return while philip ray stands by . <sssss> this is where part one ends , and while the exposition has been well handled and the production values are first rate for the era , the ending is abrupt and the story is obviously incomplete . <sssss> just as we become fully involved in the situation , the film ends . <sssss> -lrb- although for modern-day viewers , parts one & two have been conveniently joined for video and dvd releases . <sssss> -rrb- it 's no surprise that audiences of 1911 demanded to see the second reel post haste , for griffith 's enoch arden must be seen in its entirety to be a fully satisfying experience . 
ur3063013/		\tt0001593		8		even though biograph would limit him to one-reelers , dw griffith had ambitions to move on to longer films . <sssss> once or twice before this he had followed a short up with a sequel to be released a week later , but this is his first genuine two-parter , making a full , coherent story . <sssss> although biograph insisted it be released as two shorts , many theatre owners cottoned on and showed it as one film . <sssss> wisely , griffith chose to expand upon a story he had made a loose adaptation of before , enoch arden having been the inspiration for 1910 's the unchanging sea . <sssss> covering a lengthy timescale , the material is also perfectly suited to a longer running time . <sssss> griffith clearly realised that if cinema was going to flourish as a serious and unique storytelling medium , it would not only have to develop in how it conveyed information visually , but also become more subtle and naturalistic . <sssss> around the time of enoch arden he was really striving to perfect this , and the two parts are like a showcase for everything he had developed so far . <sssss> griffith opens by introducing each of the three main characters with a single title revealing their name only , followed by a shot for each which serves as a brief yet meaningful introduction . <sssss> then , without resorting to another title card , he sets up the love triangle with just some careful positioning of the three actors we have just met . <sssss> this economy of expression would later be taken up and developed by cecil b. demille and john ford . <sssss> the use of props by actors to reveal character or emotion is also beginning to develop . <sssss> in the scene where annie lee watches enoch 's boat disappear over the horizon , she stops to wipe the lens of the spyglass -- perhaps to see the boat clearer , perhaps also to wipe away a tear . <sssss> griffith was also beginning to develop the emotional impact of his camera work . <sssss> he had around this time been experimenting by throwing in the occasional functional close-up to clarify an object or action . <sssss> here however , in the scene where annie gives enoch the baby 's curl , he briefly moves the camera closer to the actors . <sssss> the close-up is not to explain the action , it is to draw the audience into it and makes us involved in this poignant moment . <sssss> this is a really important breakthrough . <sssss> please see also my comment for enoch arden part ii .

ur2467618/		\tt0001593		8		this story is a slight reworking of an early d. w. griffith short , the unchanging sea . <sssss> while both films are short , this remake is significantly longer and allows for a much fuller and more interesting tale . <sssss> it 's interesting that the movie is broken into two sections here on imdb , as i saw them both together as one film . <sssss> a man goes to sea and is shipwrecked -- leaving his wife to raise their two small kids . <sssss> many years pass and she holds out hope that he 'll return . <sssss> again and again through the years , a friend offers to marry her . <sssss> only after her kids have grown does she agree . <sssss> a short time later , the husband is rescued and returns ! <sssss> how exactly this is handled , you 'll have to see for yourself . <sssss> part i concerns the marriage , his going to sea and the shipwreck . <sssss> part ii concerns life after this up until his return . 
ur2467618/		\tt0001771		7		this comedy is a bit unusual because in his earliest directorial assignments for biograph studios , mack sennett not only was behind the camera but starred in the short films . <sssss> now at first sight you might not think this is sennett , as he bore a rather strong similarity in look to the very famous french comic , max linder . <sssss> i do n't know if sennett cultivated this look on purpose or if it was just chance . <sssss> sennett works as a barber and he 's obviously in love with the manicurist . <sssss> the problem is that lots of men coming to the salon really like her and one rich guy in particular pursues her . <sssss> eventually , sennett has had enough of watching the two of them and springs into action -- leading to a pretty amazing moving shot for 1911 . <sssss> not a brilliant comedy but unlike many of the day , it tells a complete story and is much more plot-driven than usual and has none of the usual bonking and slapping . <sssss> worth your time . 
ur1617546/		\tt0001771		5		it 's fairly typical flirting in this comedy , as pretty vivian prescott is torn between eddie dillon -lrb- who would take over the biograph comedy unit after sennett departed for keystone -rrb- and unhappy barber mack sennett , who ca n't compete on those terms with a rich dude , at least until he rescues her from the clutches of the dastardly fellow and his chauffeured car . <sssss> sennett tosses dillon and his driver out and slips a ring on the lady 's finger . <sssss> sennett 's biographs are much more naturalistic and restrained than his work at keystone . <sssss> part may have been that his wild slapstick may have been tough to get by the bosses -- even though griffith directed the curtain pole from sennett 's script in 1908 -- but i suspect had more to do with the wardrobe department . <sssss> a clown , ran the understandings of the time , had to look bizarre , and given that they were costuming the cast from the same department as griffith , they wore normal clothes in which people looked good . <sssss> decent for 1911 but not a patch on what sennett would produce on his own . 
ur2904081/		\tt0001913		9		`` swords and hearts '' is the last and the best of the seven civil war shorts griffith directed over a three-year period . <sssss> this group nicely illustrates his tracking along a very steep learning curve as he becomes ever more technically and creatively proficient with the new art form of film-making . <sssss> `` swords and hearts '' is billed as a wartime story in old virginia and entertainingly alternates between domestic and battle sequences . <sssss> the chapter captions pretty much tell the story : 1 . <sssss> hugh frazier -lrb- wilfred lucas -rrb- son of a wealthy tobacco planter 2 . <sssss> his lambert -lrb- claire mcdowell -rrb- beautiful but calculating 3 . <sssss> jennie baker -lrb- dorothy west -rrb- and her father -lrb- francis j. grandon -rrb- of the `` poor white class '' 4 . <sssss> promise me you will be mine 5 . <sssss> to join his company in the confederate army 6 . <sssss> we shall marry when you return 7 . <sssss> months later , unknown to hugh , jennie 's chance to prove her love 8 . <sssss> to steal a visit with irene 9 . <sssss> old ben -lrb- william j. butler -rrb- anticipates the bushwhackers ' attack 10 . <sssss> defeated in war , rejected in love 11 . <sssss> hugh realizes her loyalty and worth . <sssss> the story incorporates griffith 's favorite themes , the superior virtues of the poor white class and the loyalty of good negro slaves to their masters . <sssss> it is quite ambitious as at times griffith cross-cuts between three different events occurring simultaneously . <sssss> unfortunately the use of white actors in black-face in several scenes is disconcerting . <sssss> dorothy west was arguably the most contemporary looking and natural of all the silent film stars . <sssss> consequently her films from have held up better even than stuff made years later at the end of the silent film era . <sssss> west combines the seemingly contradictory qualities of adolescent femininity that fascinated griffith ; a virginal and a plucky practicality . <sssss> in the film 's best action sequence jennie demonstrates her practicality by taking hugh 's uniform and horse , then leading the yankee cavalry away from her love -lrb- during his liaison with irene -rrb- . <sssss> an accomplished rider , west does her own stunts and even shoots a yankee from horseback . <sssss> then again , what do i know ? <sssss> i 'm only a child .
